I'm Dylan â€“ I'm the founder of [Iwana Labs](https://iwanalabs.com). I've worked in the AI & ML space for almost a decade.

I've delivered successful projects for organizations like [Deliveroo](https://www.deliveroo.com/), [Boston Consulting Group (BCG)](https://www.bcg.com/), [the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/), and [the Olympics](https://www.olympics.com/).

In my free time, I like working on random side projects (open source, personal, or otherwise). Some of them have been featured in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/28/investors-are-going-nuts-for-chatgpt-ish-artificial-intelligence), praised by the [CMOs of Zapier and HubSpot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sz-Nmi_5xg&t=1432s), and reached hundreds of stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/shell-genie).

Every once in a while, I write about topics I'm interested in. You'll find a collection of my articles here, covering everything from data science and machine learning to financial independence.

If you're interested in working with me or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at [dylan@iwanalabs.com](mailto:dylan@iwanalabs.com).
