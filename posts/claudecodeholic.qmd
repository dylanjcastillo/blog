Hi, I'm Dylan, and I'm a ClaudeCodeholic.

I'm not addicted because Claude Code makes me more productive. I'm addicted because it dulls the *pain* of thinking and makes development a never ending bet of "if I change the prompt just one more time, it'll finally get it right."

I don't care about those studies comparing how much better or worse people do with AI coding tools. I'd still use it, even if I was 50% less productive.

It might take twice as long to finish what I’m trying to build. Maybe I never finish it at all. But I feel I'm making progress. Above all, I hardly need to be *there*.

Companies worship productivity. I worship comfort. And Claude Code is my warm bed on a cold night of winter.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a prompt to finish, before I can continue doomscrolling on reddit.
