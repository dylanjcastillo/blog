Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dylan, the founder of [Iwana Labs](https://iwanalabs.com).

I've been working in AI for the [past 8 years](https://linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo) and I like working on [open-source projects](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo). I've delivered projects for large-scale corporations, government agencies, and startups.

I'm currently freelancing as an AI engineer and working on [Namemancer](https://namemancer.com).

## Today I Learned (TIL)

I'm a big fan of [Simon Willison's "TIL" posts](https://til.simonwillison.net/), so I copied his idea.

They're a great way to force yourself to write more often by lowering the bar for what it's worth sharing.

These are short, less polished posts about things I've learned that I think others might find useful.
