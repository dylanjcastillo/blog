To make `Shift+Enter` create a new line in Claude Code when working with [Alacritty/Zellij](https://dylancastillo.co/til/install-alacritty-and-zellij-in-macos.html), you need to add the following lines to `~/.config/alacritty.toml`:

```shell
[keyboard]
bindings = [
    { key = "Return", mods = "Shift", chars = "\n" } 
]
```

I found the solution in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1300).

Running `/terminal-setup` didn't work for me.
