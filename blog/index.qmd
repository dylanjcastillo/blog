Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dylan, the founder of [Iwana Labs](https://iwanalabs.com).

I've been working with AI for the [past 8 years](https://linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo) and am an [open-source contributor](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo). I've delivered projects for large-scale corporations, government agencies, and startups. I'm currently freelancing as an AI engineer at [REMATIQ](https://rematiq.com) and working on a few personal projects.

Some of my open-source work and projects have been featured in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/28/investors-are-going-nuts-for-chatgpt-ish-artificial-intelligence), praised by the [CMOs of Zapier and HubSpot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sz-Nmi_5xg&t=1432s), and reached hundreds of stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/shell-genie). 

## Posts

This collection features my longer posts on AI, Data Science, programming, and occasional personal topics like yearly reviews or random thoughts.

## TIL

Inspired by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/til/) I've decided to start keeping a collection of short posts that I've written to help me remember things. 

I believe that reducing the bar in terms of how developed a post needs to be will allow me to post more often, plus it'll also help me remember things better. 

The posts here are mostly technical and won't go into that much detail.
