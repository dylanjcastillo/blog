This is my annual review. I use it as a way to reflect on the past year and record who I am at the time of writing.

It's more for me than for you, but I hope you find it interesting.

If it's me rereading this, welcome back. This is Dylan from 2024.

## What went well?

This year, I wrote code 322 days out of 365. It's a 16% increase from last year. That's a lot of code and a lot of learning. I'm happy with that.

Financially, I doubled my revenue from last year. I worked on 9 different projects this year with 7 clients. My biggest client represented 33% of my revenue.

I'm moving in the right direction but I also want to step away from daily billing towards a fixed price model or value-based pricing, as my current model doesn't scale well. Right now, 25% of my revenue comes from fixed price projects the rest is daily.

Value-based pricing is the dream, but I've found it a lot more challenging, because:

On the one hand, your client:

1. Needs to have a painful, well-defined and quantifiable problem.
2. Needs to have a large budget to solve the problem.

On the other hand, you:

1. Need to have the expertise to solve that specific problem.
2. Need to have credibility and access to the client.

Say, for example, you're an expert in optimizing RAG pipelines for a specific industry. 

## What didn't go well?

In my last personal snapshot, I said that I wanted to do more stand-up comedy and start making videos about technical topics. I did neither.

But I feel at peace with that. Stand-up comedy has been one of the funniest hobbies I've ever had. But it really takes a lot of time to get good at it, and this year I decided that I had to focus on the things that would move the needle for me.

Earlier this year, my wife and I were living at an unsustainable pace. Eventually, this took a toll on our health. So I realized that I needed to prioritize the things that were most important to me.

## What are the plans for next year?
