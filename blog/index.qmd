Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dylan, the founder of [Iwana Labs](https://iwanalabs.com).

I've been working in AI for the [past 8 years](https://linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo) and I like working on [open-source projects](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo). I've delivered projects for large-scale corporations, government agencies, and startups.

I'm currently freelancing as an AI engineer at [REMATIQ](https://rematiq.com) and working on [Namemancer](https://namemancer.com).

## Posts

This collection features my longer posts on technical topics. I've also included some personal posts like yearly reviews.

## Today I Learned (TIL)

Inspired by [Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net/), I've started a collection of short technical posts of things I've learned and think others might find useful.

I'm trying to force myself to write more, by reducing the friction of the writing process. And this seems like a good way to do that.
