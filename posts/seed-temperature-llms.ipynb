    "Temperature and seed are commonly used parameters when interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). They're also a source of confusion for many people. In this post, I'll show you what they are and how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the output by scaling the logits of the tokens before applying the softmax function. Seed is also a parameter that controls the randomness of how the model selects tokens during text generation. It sets the initial state of the random number generator, which is then used for the sampling of the tokens during the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature is available for most providers, while seed is only available for [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) and open-weight models (that I know of).\n",

    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How LLMs generate text\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how seed and temperature work, we first need to understand how LLMs generate text. Provided with a prompt, a model uses what's called a [decoding strategy](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/generation_strategies) to generate the next token.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many strategies, but for this post, we'll focus on just two: **greedy search** and **sampling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **greedy search**, the model picks the token with the highest probability at each step. In **sampling**, the model picks a token based on the probability distribution of the tokens in the vocabulary. In both cases, the model will calculate the probability of each token in the vocabulary^[Modern LLMs often have a vocabulary of 100k+ tokens], and use that to pick the next token. Let's see an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What's the favorite dish of Chuck Norris?\n",
    "\n",
    "These might be the top 5 most likely next tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | Token | Probability |\n",
    "|------|-------|-------------|\n",
    "| 1 | 'Dynamite' | 0.5823 |\n",
    "| 2 | 'Venom' | 0.2891 |\n",
    "| 3 | 'Himself' | 0.0788 |\n",
    "| 4 | 'Radiation' | 0.0354 |\n",
    "| 5 | 'You' | 0.0144 |\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model uses **greedy search**, it will pick the token with the highest probability, which is 'Dynamite'. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it uses **sampling**, it will make a random selection based on those probabilities. So, the model has a 58% chance of picking 'Dynamite', a 29% chance of picking 'Venom', a 8% chance of picking 'Himself', a 4% chance of picking 'Radiation', and a 1% chance of picking 'You'.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. `seed` is only available for `OpenAI` and open-weight models.\n",
    "2. To get the most deterministic output for a given prompt, set temperature to 0. This minimizes randomness.\n",

    "4. If you don't need reproducible results and want unique outputs on every run, you can omit the seed parameter entirely.\n",
    "5. Be aware that even if you set a temperature of 0 and a seed, outputs are not guaranteed to be identical. Providers [might change model configurations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/advanced-usage#reproducible-outputs) that might impact the output. For OpenAI models, you can monitor such changes by keeping track of the [system_fingerprint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/backward-compatibility) provided in the responses. "

    "\n",
    "In this post, we explored how the temperature and seed parameters control the output of Large Language Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned that temperature adjusts the level of randomness: low values (near 0) produce more predictable, deterministic outputs, while high values (near 1) encourage more creative and varied results. In contrast, the seed makes the generation process reproducible. While the specific seed value isn't important, fixing it ensures you get the same output for a given prompt and set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, remember that while temperature is a near-universal setting, seed is only available (at the time of writing) for OpenAI and open-weight models.\n",
