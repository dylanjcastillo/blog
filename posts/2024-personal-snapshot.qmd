This is my annual review. I use it as a way to reflect on the past year and get a snapshot of "who I am" at the time of writing.

It's more for me than for you, but I hope you find it interesting.

If it's me rereading this, welcome back. This is Dylan from 2024.

I've structured the previous snapshots in things that went well and things that didn't go well. This year, I'm going to try something different.

I'm going to write things in a chronological order, and I'll try to write about 10 things I did this year.

## Early 2024

In my last personal snapshot, I said that I was going to focus on building a consulting practice and doing more stand up comedy. I did both half-heartedly.

I thought of an [idea](https://aitheneum.iwanalabs.com/) that I thought that could help go into the product route, so during January and February I spent most of my time building a prototype, while I was negotiating with potential clients.

My idea, AItheneum^[yes, I know, what a terrible name.], was a tool to help people read classic philosophy books by making them easier to understand using AI. I pitched it as a way to make classic books more accessible to modern readers.

It was a fun project to work on, but it wasn't really solving anyone's problem. It was a vitamin, not a painkiller. And I knew it from the start.

By the time I released it, I immediately knew that I essentially wasted 2 months of my time.

In parallel, I was doing open mics almost every week. That was one of the most fun things I've ever done, even if I almost threw up every time I went on stage.

But stand up comedy has a few downsides:

1. If you want to be good at stand up, you need to write everyday. I tried, but that often take time from focusing on my long term goals.
2. Open mics take a lot of time. To practice an 8 minute set, I'd often have to dedicate 1.5 hours of commuting + 1 hour of show (during which I did my 8 minutes).
3. Open mics are during weekday evenings, which isn't great if you want to keep a healthy schedule.

Even then, I didn't really decided to stop until we had a health situation at home that made me reconsider my priorities. For the first months of the year my wife and I were living at an unsustainable pace. At some point, this broke down and we had to take a step back.

# Mid 2024

This year, I wrote code 322 days out of 365. It's a 16% increase from last year. That's a lot of code and a lot of learning. I'm happy with that.

Financially, I doubled my revenue from last year. I worked on 9 different projects this year with 7 clients. My biggest client represented 33% of my revenue. That's an improvement from last year, where 68% of my revenue came from a single client.

I also did more sales this year. I wrote quite a few proposals, and now feel quite comfortable writing them. I'm also getting better at selling my services.

In terms of excercise, this year I did:

- 112 strength training sessions (approx. 2.2 sessions per week)
- 3,488 minutes of cardio (approx. 60 minutes per week)

In the second half of the year I started being more disciplined about the strength training, and I'm happy with the results.

This roughly translates to 60 minutes of cardio per week. It's not a lot, but I'm happy that at least I was consistent with it.

I'm moving in the right direction but I also want to step away from daily billing towards a fixed price model or value-based pricing, as my current model doesn't scale well. Right now, 25% of my revenue comes from fixed price projects the rest is daily.

Value-based pricing is the dream, but I've found it a lot more challenging, because:

On the one hand, your client:

1. Needs to have a painful, well-defined and quantifiable problem.
2. Needs to have a large budget to solve the problem.

On the other hand, you:

1. Need to have the expertise to solve that specific problem.
2. Need to have credibility and access to the client.

Say, for example, you're an expert in optimizing RAG pipelines for a specific industry.

## What didn't go well?

But I feel at peace with that. Stand-up comedy has been one of the funniest hobbies I've ever had. But it really takes a lot of time to get good at it, and this year I decided that I had to focus on the things that would move the needle for me.

Earlier this year, my wife and I were living at an unsustainable pace. Eventually, this took a toll on our health. So I realized that I needed to prioritize the things that were most important to me.

## What are the plans for next year?
