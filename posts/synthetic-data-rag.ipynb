    "1. Sign up and generate [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) API keys.\n",
    "2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following lines:\n",

    "    LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Create a virtual environment in Python (I use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) and install the following packages: `langchain`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain-community`, `jupyter`, `chromadb`, `python-dotenv`, `nest_asyncio`, and `sentence-transformers`.\n",
    "4. Download the People Group's section from GitLab's [handbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/tree/main/content/handbook/people-group).\n",

    "I'm also assuming you're familiar with the basics of RAG systems and how to use vector databases. If you need a refresher, you can check out my [RAG tutorial](https://dylancastillo.co/posts/what-is-rag.html).\n",

    "To evaluate the retrieval part of the RAG system, you can use metrics such as recall@k, precision@k, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).\n",

    "For this tutorial, you'll use two metrics: MRR and recall@k.\n",

    "#### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)\n",

    "MRR measures how well the RAG system retrieves relevant documents. It calculates the average of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant document for each query. It essentially measures how quickly the system retrieves the first relevant document for a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reciprocal Rank (RR) is calculated for a single query. It is the reciprocal of the rank at which the first relevant document is found. For example, if the first relevant item is at position 1, the RR is 1. If it's at position 3, the RR is $1/3$. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RR = \\frac{1}{rank}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $rank$ is the position of the first relevant document.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRR is the average of the Reciprocal Rank scores across all your queries. It provides a single, aggregate measure of retrieval performance. An MRR of 1 means you found the correct document at the first position for every query. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MRR = \\frac{1}{|Q|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|Q|} \\frac{1}{rank}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|Q|$ is the number of queries and $rank_i$ is the position of the first relevant document for query $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall@k\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall@k measures the proportion of relevant documents retrieved in the top k results. It helps you understand how many relevant documents are retrieved by the RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you retrieve 5 documents and 3 of them are relevant, recall@5 is 3/5 = 0.6. The formula is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Recall@k = \\frac{|\\text{relevant documents in top k}|}{|\\text{total relevant documents}|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the numerator is the number of relevant documents retrieved in the top k results, and the denominator is the total number of relevant documents for the query. To get the overall performance, you average the Recall@k values across all queries. \n",
