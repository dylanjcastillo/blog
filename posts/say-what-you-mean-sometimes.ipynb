    "When I read [Let Me Speak Freely?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442) by Tam et al. I thought they raised an interesting question: does constraining LLM outputs to structured formats impact the quality of their responses?\n",
    "\n",
    "In both the original study and their recent update, Tam et al. concluded that structured generation constraints do indeed affect LLM performance. They found that \"structured generation constraints significantly impact LLM performance across various tasks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But the study had major flaws. The [.txt](https://dottxt.co/) team wrote a very compelling [rebuttal](https://dottxt.co/blog/let-me-speak-freely) to the paper. They demonstrate that Tam, et al. results were mostly due to poor prompting, unfair comparisons and the improper use of an \"AI parser\" rather than the use of structured outputs (at least for Llama 3 8B). \n",
    "\n",
    "They were right but it still left me wondering how well their results generalize. They only tested Llama 3 8B^[In this setup, but they've also shared results of other open-weight models in a different setup (https://blog.dottxt.co/performance-gsm8k.html)], which represents a small fraction of the LLMs powering applications in production today. Open-weight models offer a lot of flexibility on how to *structure* your output, such as using specific [regex expressions](https://dottxt-ai.github.io/outlines/latest/reference/generation/regex/) that the output must match instead of a specific JSON schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proprietary models lack this flexibility. Right now, JSON is the only structured output format guaranteed to work across most providers. Given this constraint, would the .txt teamâ€™s results still hold?\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus, both studies focused on tasks that might not be a good proxy for the full range of tasks people use LLMs for. For example, would the rebuttal results be different in settings outside of simple reasoning tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replicate the results from .txt's rebuttal using Llama 3 8B.\n",
    "2. Replicate the same tasks using a proprietary model (GPT-4o-mini).\n",
    "3. Test results on a broader set of tasks such as [LiveBench](https://livebench.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This article presents the results of the first two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The results\n",
    "\n",
    "## The original tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "The original reasoning tasks from Tam et al. were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [GSM8K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k): A dataset from of grade school math word problems.\n",
    "2. [Last Letter](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChilleD/LastLetterConcat): A dataset of simple word puzzles that require concatening the last letters of a list of names.\n",
    "3. [Shuffle Object](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/tracking_shuffled_objects): A dataset that requires reasoning about the state of a system after a sequence of shuffling operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tam et al. also included four classification tasks in their study, where they observed that structured outputs resulted in better performance. The .txt team's rebuttal excluded these classification tasks. I also believe that structured outputs are likely better for classification tasks. So, I excluded them from my analysis as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Replicating .txt's rebuttal\n",
    "\n",
    ".txt made it very easy to reproduce their results by sharing their [code on Github](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/demos/tree/main/say-what-you-mean). I just set up a machine at [Modal](https://modal.com/) and ran the code and reproduced their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, while going through the code, I noticed some small issues with the prompts. So I decided to tweak them a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are .txt's original results compared to mine, after the prompt adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task              | Unstructured (.txt) | Structured (.txt) | Unstructured (Me, 3-shot) | Structured (Me, 3-shot) |\n",
    "|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **GSM8K**         | 77.18                 | 77.79               | 79.98            | 79.45          |\n",
    "| **Last Letter**   | 73.33                 | 77.33               | 74.00            | 78.00          |\n",
    "| **Shuffle Object**| 40.72                 | 44.35               | 42.68            | 43.90          |\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for **Structured** in the **Shuffle Object** task, I was able to improve all the metrics. In **GSM8K's** case, even reversing .txt's result, with **Unstructured** outperforming **Structured** by a small margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I don't think this matters much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their conclusion still holds: structured outputs are either as good as or better than unstructured outputs, in the tasks considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll explain the prompt changes I made below, so that you can judge for yourself if they make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formatting few-shot examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **GSM8K** and **Last Letter** tasks, the few-shot prompt for both unstructured and structured used examples formatted as JSON objects and asked the LLM to produce the output in the same format, from which the answer was extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "That felt unfair. Even though you're not formally constraining the LLM to produce a JSON object, you're still asking it to format its response in somewhat unnatural way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I adjusted the prompts to be as similar as possible while still trying to get the most out of each approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in **GSM8K**, the unstructured prompt is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You are an expert in solving grade school math tasks. You will be presented with a grade-school math word problem and be asked to solve it.\n",
    "> You will always respond in the following format:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <str, reasoning about the answer>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ANSWER: <int, final answer>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> First, provide your step by step reasoning. Then, in ANSWER, provide an integer that corresponds to the correct answer to the question. Don't include any other text in ANSWER.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the structured prompt is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You are an expert in solving grade school math tasks. You will be presented with a grade-school math word problem and be asked to solve it.\n",
    "> You will always respond in the following format:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> {\"reasoning\": <str, reasoning about the answer>, \"answer\": <int, final answer>}\n",
    ">\n",
    "> First, provide your step by step reasoning about the answer. Then, in the \"answer\" field, provide an integer that corresponds to the correct answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the tasks, I used a 3-shot prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clarifying the task\n",
    "\n",
    "I also clarified the prompts. The description of the task in the original **Last Letter** prompt was:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You are an expert in solving simple word puzzles using reasoning steps. Your specific task is going to be to take a list of 4 names and reason about the last letter of each ., then you will concatenate those letters into a word. \n",
    "\n",
    "I changed it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You are an expert in solving word puzzles. Your specific task is going to be to take a list of 4 names, get the last letter of each and concatenate these letters into a word. \n",
    "\n",
    "The original prompt was reasonable, but I thought the new version was clearer. Through trial and error, I've learned that when working with LLMs, it's best to be as clear and direct as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating GPT-4o-mini\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same setup as before, I ran the same tasks with `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the results, including the original results from Tam et al. for comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Task**        | **Method**   | **NL** | **FRI** | **JSON-Mode** | **JSON-Schema** |\n",
    "|-----------------|--------------|--------|---------|---------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **GSM8K**       | **Tam et al.** | 94.57  | 87.17   | 86.95         | 91.71            |\n",
    "|                 | **Me (0-shot)** | 92.80  | 91.43   | 93.56         | 93.63            |\n",
    "|                 | **Me (3-shot)** | 93.10  | 93.18   | 93.63         | 93.18            |\n",
    "| **Last Letter** | **Tam et al.** | 83.11  | 84.73   | 76.00         | 86.07            |\n",
    "|                 | **Me (0-shot)** | 83.33  | 84.00   | 90.67         | 87.33            |\n",
    "|                 | **Me (3-shot)** | 90.00  | 91.33   | 90.67         | 88.67            |\n",
    "| **Shuffle Obj** | **Tam et al.** | 82.85  | 81.46   | 76.43         | 81.77            |\n",
    "|                 | **Me (0-shot)** | 94.31  | 82.11   | 81.71         | 87.40            |\n",
    "|                 | **Me (3-shot)** | 87.40  | 70.73   | 63.41         | 67.48            |\n",
    "\n",
    "*NL* stands for \"Natural Language\". This would correspond to the *Unstructured* method in the previous table.\n",
    "\n",
    "*FRI* stands for \"Format Restricting Instructions\", which is a JSON generated through the OpenAI's [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). *JSON-Mode* is a JSON generated through the OpenAI's [JSON mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#json-mode). *JSON-Schema* is a JSON generated using [constrained decoding](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/). \n",
    "\n",
    "*JSON-Schema* would be the most comparable to **Structured** in the previous table but, for real-life applications, you don't really care about how the output is formatted. You just want to get the output in the format you want. So, for the sake of comparison, I will consider the three other methods as structured outputs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analyzing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to what the .txt team found, you can see that after adjusting the prompts, the performance of structured outputs increases substantially compared to Tam et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for *NL* in **GSM8k** and *FRI* in **Last Letter**, I was able to improve all the metrics for both unstructured and structured outputs using a 0-shot prompt. For 3-shot prompts, I improved **GSM8k** and **Last Letter** across all methods, and *NL* in **Shuffle Object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These counter-intuitive results of 3-shot prompting hurting performance are in line with previous [analyses](https://python.useinstructor.com/blog/2024/09/26/bad-schemas-could-break-your-llm-structured-outputs/?h=bad+sc#modes-and-models). I will dive deeper into this in a future article.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GSM8k** and **Last Letter** show very similar results between unstructured and structured outputs. I don't believe there's enough evidence to say that structured outputs are better than unstructured outputs in these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **Shuffle Object** shows a clear advantage for unstructured outputs over structured outputs. I wasn't expecting this, and even after adjusting the prompts, I couldn't reduce the gap significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    " So, even though Tam et al. had issues in their study, their conclusion seems to hold. There are cases where unstructured outputs are better than structured outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're a developer, you'll be pleased to know that the answer to wether you should use structured or unstructured outputs is: [it depends](https://www.reddit.com/r/orlybooks/comments/50meb5/it_depends/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I love using structured outputs in my daily work, because it makes it easier to work with the output of LLMs. I always encourage clients who aren't using them yet to give it a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, until there's sufficient evidence in favor of one approach over the other, it's best to test yourself what works best for your specific use case. Don't rely on random posts from random people on the internet. Run your own evals and see for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a good chance that structured outputs will have comparable quality to unstructured outputs in most cases. But, especially in cases where you're not generating complex structured outputs, you might be losing out on easy performance gains by not testing out unstructured outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway of this article shouldn't be that structured outputs are better than or worse than unstructured outputs in every possible task. Just that, in some cases, one or the other might be better. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, say what you mean... sometimes."
