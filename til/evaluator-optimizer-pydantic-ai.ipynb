    "\n",
    "Evaluator-optimizer is a pattern that has an LLM generator and an LLM evaluator. The generator generates a solution and the evaluator evaluates if the solution is good enough. If it's not, the generator is given feedback and it generates a new solution. This process is repeated until the solution is good enough.\n",

      "**The Complex Reality of Hard Drug Consumption**\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard drugs â€” substances such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines, and crack â€” have long been a subject of concern worldwide due to their profound impact on individuals and society. The consumption of these drugs is not merely a matter of personal choice but a complex issue influenced by social, economic, psychological, and cultural factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding Hard Drugs and Their Effects**\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard drugs are characterized by their high potential for addiction and severe physical and psychological effects. Unlike softer substances such as marijuana or alcohol (when consumed responsibly), hard drugs often disrupt brain function dramatically, leading to addiction, mental health disorders, and significant physical health problems. Users may experience paranoia, hallucinations, heart issues, and even fatal overdoses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The allure of hard drugs often stems from their ability to produce intense euphoria or numb emotional pain temporarily. However, this fleeting escape comes at a steep cost. Dependence quickly sets in, making cessation incredibly difficult and often trapping users in a cycle of abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Social and Economic Implications**\n",
      "\n",
      "The ramifications of hard drug consumption ripple beyond the individual. Families endure emotional and financial strain, communities face increased crime rates and reduced public safety, and healthcare systems are burdened with treating overdoses and long-term complications. Moreover, productivity declines as addiction interferes with employment, contributing to broader economic challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many users come from marginalized backgrounds, where poverty, trauma, and lack of education or opportunity make drugs seem like a refuge or an escape. This correlation highlights that addressing drug consumption isn't only a matter of law enforcement but of social equity and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges in Addressing Hard Drug Use**\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to reduce hard drug consumption have varied widely, from strict punitive measures to harm reduction strategies. While criminalization seeks to deter use, it often leads to overcrowded prisons and can exacerbate social stigma, making it harder for users to seek help. Conversely, approaches like supervised consumption sites, needle exchange programs, and accessible addiction treatment aim to minimize harm and promote recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention and education are critical components. Informing communities about the risks of hard drugs and providing mental health support can reduce initial experimentation and help those at risk before addiction takes hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Moving Towards Compassionate Solutions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the consumption of hard drugs is a multifaceted issue requiring balanced and compassionate responses. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and communities must work together to create environments that prioritize treatment over punishment, recognize addiction as a health issue, and promote social support.\n",
      "\n",
      "By understanding the complex realities behind hard drug use, society can better address its consequences and help those affected find a path to recovery and hope.\n"
