I'm Dylan â€“ I'm the founder of [Iwana Labs](https://iwanalabs.com). I've worked in the AI & ML space for almost a decade.

I've delivered successful projects for organizations like Deliveroo, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the European Commission, and the Olympics.

In my free time, I like working on random side projects and contributing to open-source projects. Some of them have been featured in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/28/investors-are-going-nuts-for-chatgpt-ish-artificial-intelligence), praised by the [CMOs of Zapier and HubSpot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sz-Nmi_5xg&t=1432s), and reached hundreds of stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/shell-genie). 

When I find the time, I write about topics I'm interested in. You'll find a collection of my articles here, covering everything from data science and machine learning to financial independence.

If you're interested in working with me or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at [dylan@iwanalabs.com](mailto:dylan@iwanalabs.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo/). I'd love to hear from you!
