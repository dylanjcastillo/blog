Ever since I saw [The Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wU8k2kDaTo), I've wanted to be a hacker.

When I say hacker, I mean having a cool-looking terminal. The kind that makes people think I’m a stealing millions from banks when, in reality, I’m just struggling to exit vim.

I use macOS. The closest I've been to being a hacker is using [vim hotkeys](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) in VSCode.

It’s not that I haven’t tried to look the part. I was a just one audio driver away from saying ["I use Arch btw"](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/9xgfxq/why_i_use_arch_btw/). I did succeed with Ubuntu, but honestly, using Linux as my main OS always felt like too much work^[I'm sure you're itching to explain how I'm completely wrong about this, and how you haven't had to fix anything in years. Please reach me at [elon@x.com](mailto:elon@x.com)]. So that didn't last long.

But, today, after reading about [DHH's Omakub](https://world.hey.com/dhh/introducing-omakub-354db366), I though it was time to give my hacker dreams a second shot.

Installing Ubuntu felt like a bit too much work^[Can you even install Ubuntu on a Mac?], so I decided to settle on just upgrading my terminal.

I decided to set up Alacritty, Zellij, and Neovim on my M3 MacBook Pro.

Sure, I have client projects to deliver. But how could I let go of one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to procrastinate and imagine I'm a genius hacker for an afternoon?

## Installing Alacritty

Alacritty is a terminal emulator, similar to [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) and others. It's selling point is that it's very fast due to GPU-acceleration. Plus, you also get 256 colors support by default.

The best way to install it is using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask alacritty
```

Then, you you can customize it to your liking by creating a `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` file.

I ended up modifying just a couple of things:

1. Increase padding.
2. Change the font.
3. Change the color scheme. I used One Dark from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/r-darwish/f8bb21a6c89a02c4bef76cc38bddad39).

<details>
<summary>Show the code</summary>

```yaml
[window]
padding.x = 16
padding.y = 14
decorations = "none" # Removes the window decoration (title bar, etc.)

[font]
size = 13

# FiraCode Nerd Font
normal = { family = "FiraCode Nerd Font", style = "Regular" }
bold = { family = "FiraCode Nerd Font", style = "Bold" }
italic = { family = "FiraCode Nerd Font", style = "Italic" }

# One Dark theme
[colors]
[colors.primary]
background = '0x1e2127'
foreground = '0xabb2bf'
bright_foreground = '0xe6efff'

# Normal colors
[colors.normal]
black = '0x1e2127'
red = '0xe06c75'
green = '0x98c379'
yellow = '0xd19a66'
blue = '0x61afef'
magenta = '0xc678dd'
cyan = '0x56b6c2'
white = '0x828791'

# Bright colors
[colors.bright]
black = '0x5c6370'
red = '0xe06c75'
green = '0x98c379'
yellow = '0xd19a66'
blue = '0x61afef'
magenta = '0xc678dd'
cyan = '0x56b6c2'
white = '0xe6efff'

# Dim colors
[colors.dim]
black = '0x1e2127'
red = '0xe06c75'
green = '0x98c379'
yellow = '0xd19a66'
blue = '0x61afef'
magenta = '0xc678dd'
cyan = '0x56b6c2'
white = '0x828791'
```

</details>

I use [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) Nerd Font. [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) are a collection of fonts that include glyphs such as icons that represent folders, file types, [weird arrows](https://github.com/ryanoasis/powerline-extra-symbols/blob/master/img/fontforge.png?raw=true), etc.

You can install them using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install font-<name-of-the-font>-nerd-font # For example, font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

## Installing Zellij

Zellij is an improved version of [`tmux`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux). Whenever I used tmux, I spent half my time figuring out the key bindings. Zellij shows the key bindings on screen (unless you disable it), which greatly improves the user experience.

This is what it looks like:

![Zellij](images/zellij-screenshot.png)

Same as before, the best way to install it is using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install zellij
```

You can customize it by creating a `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl` file.

I just copied the [One Half Dark](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/blob/main/zellij-utils/assets/themes/one-half-dark.kdl) theme they provide.

```kdl
theme "one-half-dark"

themes {
    one-half-dark {
        fg 169 177 214
        bg 26 27 38
        black 56 62 90
        red 249 51 87
        green 158 206 106
        yellow 224 175 104
        blue 122 162 247
        magenta 187 154 247
        cyan 42 195 222
        white 192 202 245
        orange 255 158 100
    }
}
```

Is One Half Dark the same as One Dark? I don't really know. I like to live dangerously.

### Making Zellij play nice with Alacritty

Getting Alacritty to work with Zellij took me a while to figure out. But luckily it's as simple as adding the full path to the `zellij` binary in the `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` file.

```yaml
[shell]
     program = "/opt/homebrew/opt/bin/zellij"
```

## Installing Neovim and LazyVim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a fork from [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), that solves some of Vim's issues^[Including its horrible website.]. I didn't really know if it was better or worse than Vim, but given that DHH recommended it, I thought it was a good idea to give it a shot.

[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) is a premade configuration for Neovim. The purists will probably hate it, but it's a good start.

I had my own `.vimrc`, and after trying LazyVim for 30 minutes or so, I realized my config sucked.

First, install Neovim using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install neovim
```

Then, install LazyVim.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
```

So far, I've only made a few changes:

- Installed [Copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim), [CopilotChat](https://github.com/CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim), and [mini-surround](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.surround).
- Installed [One Dark](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim) color scheme.

The plugins I mentioned are available in `:LazyExtras`, so it's very easy to install them. Run `:LazyExtras`, select the plugins, and then install them with {{<kbd I >}}.

To install `One Dark`, you must create a new file in `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` containing the following code:

```lua
return {
  { "navarasu/onedark.nvim" },

  -- Configure LazyVim to load One Dark
  {
    "LazyVim/LazyVim",
    opts = {
      colorscheme = "onedark",
    },
  },
}
```

## Other useful tools

While exploring [Omakub's repository](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/), I also learned about other useful tools that I've now included in my daily workflow:

### lazydocker

[lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker): A simple terminal UI to manage everything Docker. Much better than everything else I've used.

Docker is great. But, until now, the experience of managing Docker containers sucked.

Take a look at the main screen:

### lazygit

[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a simple terminal UI for `git`.

I've found it better than GitHub Desktop when doing complex operations.

Here's a screenshot of the main screen:

![lazygit](images/lazygit-screenshot.png)

### eza

[eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) is an improved version of `ls`.

I also added a couple of aliases from Omakub:

```bash
alias ls='eza -lh --group-directories-first --icons --hyperlink'
alias lsa='ls -a'
alias lt='eza --tree --level=2 --long --icons --git'
alias lta='lt -a'
```

If you run `lta` you'll get a nice view of the current directory.

## Conclusion

That's all. I hope you learned something from this post or, at least, got a cool looking terminal.

There's nothing else to say except that I'm never going to recover those 4 hours of my life.

I should get back to work.
