You can't stop using Claude Code not because it makes you more productive, but because it eases the *pain* of thinking. 

All those charts comparing how much better or worse people do with AI coding tools don't matter.

Even if you were 50% less productive, you'd still use Claude Code, Cursor, Kilo Code, or whatever new coding tool some guys in SF come up with.

It takes me twice as long to complete the task. But I don't need to be *there*.

We only talk about adoption driven by productivity because companies care about that, but people don't.

People want comfort and AI coding tools are the warm bed in a cold night of winter for developers.
