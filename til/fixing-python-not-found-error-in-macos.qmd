After the last macOS update, I started getting the following error when trying to run `poetry install`:

```shell
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'python'
```

I went through GitHub issues, StackOverflow questions, and blog posts, but none of the suggested solutions worked.

Finally, I found the solution somewhat hidden in this [blog post](https://mac.install.guide/python/brew).

So, what's the fix?

ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å

Just add the following line to your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="$(brew --prefix python)/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```

This gets the installation prefix for `python` installed via Homebrew (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12`), gets the `libexec/bin` directory, and adds it to the PATH.

In that `libexec/bin`, there's a `python` executable that gets called when you run `python` in the terminal.

That's all. Hope that helps!
