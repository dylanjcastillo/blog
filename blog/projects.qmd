I'm Dylan â€“ I'm the founder of [Iwana Labs](https://iwanalabs.com). I've working in the AI & ML space for almost a decade.

I've delivered successful projects for organizations like Deliveroo, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the European Commission, and the Olympics.

In my free time, I like writing. You'll find a collection of my articles here, covering everything from data science and machine learning to financial independence.

If you're interested in working with me or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at dylan@iwanalabs.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear from you!
