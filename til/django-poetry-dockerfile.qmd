[Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/) makes over $100k/month with a single VPS using PHP and jQuery. And until very recently, his deployment process was simply [uploading files via FTP](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28838537).

If you focus on what your users want and know how to market your product, you can make a lot of money.

Which is why I decided to stay poor and spent an inordinate amount of time improving my deployment process.

Who needs money when you can get the satisfaction of that beautiful green check mark after you've run your CI/CD pipeline?

Anyways...

These days, I'm using [kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) to deploy most of my projects.

I used to hate Docker. But, like with Gollum, I've come to realize that it's not that bad after all.

I wanted to create a simple Dockerfile to run a Django app using Poetry, with a SQLite database, and hot reload. Additionally, I wanted to switch between the development and production versions of the container.

So here's a simple Dockerfile that does just that.

## Project structure

This is my project structure:

```bash
.
├── db/
├── src/
├── entrypoint.sh
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── poetry.lock
└── pyproject.toml
```

The `src/` directory contains the Django project. The `db/` directory contains the SQLite database. The `entrypoint.sh` file is the entrypoint for the Docker container.

If your project is not structured in a similar way, you might need to adapt the files below to your needs.

## Dockerfile

I created a `Dockerfile` that fulfilled this:

1. A base stage with Python 3.10 and Poetry installed.
2. A builder stage that installs the dependencies.
3. A runner stage that copies the virtual environment from the builder stage.
4. A development stage that runs the entrypoint as a root user.
5. A production stage that runs the entrypoint as a non-root user.

Here's the full `Dockerfile`:

<details>
<summary>Dockerfile</summary>

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim AS base

ENV POETRY_HOME=/opt/poetry
ENV PATH=${POETRY_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
    curl \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - && poetry --version

FROM base AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
RUN poetry install --only main --no-interaction

FROM base AS runner

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.venv/ /app/.venv/

COPY . /app
RUN mkdir -p /db

EXPOSE 8000

RUN chmod +x /app/src/entrypoint.sh

FROM runner AS development

WORKDIR /app/src
ENTRYPOINT [ "/app/src/entrypoint.sh" ]

FROM runner AS production

# Set user and group
ARG user=django
ARG group=django
ARG uid=1000
ARG gid=1000
RUN groupadd -g ${gid} ${group}
RUN useradd -u ${uid} -g ${group} -s /bin/sh -m ${user}

# Switch to user
RUN chown -R ${uid}:${gid} /app
RUN chown -R ${uid}:${gid} /db

USER ${uid}:${gid}

WORKDIR /app/src
ENTRYPOINT [ "/app/src/entrypoint.sh" ]
```

</details>

## Entrypoint

For `entrypoint.sh` I use this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" = "production" ]; then
    echo "Running in production mode"
    exec poetry run gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py
elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" = "development" ]; then
    echo "Running in development mode"
    exec poetry run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
else
    echo "ENVIRONMENT variable is not set"
fi
```

If `ENVIRONMENT` is set to `production`, the container will run the production server using gunicorn. If it is `development`, the container will run Django's development server.

## Docker-compose

Then, I have a docker-compose that lets you run the development and production containers:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: ${ENVIRONMENT}
    platform: linux/amd64
    environment:
      - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=${DJANGO_SECRET_KEY}
      - DJANGO_DEBUG=${DJANGO_DEBUG}
      - DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=${DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT}
      - DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=${DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS}
      - DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS=${DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS}
      - DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD=${DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD}
      - DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=${DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE}
      - DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=${DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE}
      - CACHE_REDIS_URL=${CACHE_REDIS_URL}
      - ENVIRONMENT=${ENVIRONMENT}
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "./db/:/app/db/"
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync
          path: ./src/
          target: /app/src
        - action: rebuild
          path: pyproject.toml
```

In this `docker-compose`, I use `ENVIRONMENT` to switch between the development and production containers.

I also use the [Compose Watch](https://docs.docker.com/compose/file-watch/) to reload the container when I make changes to the code and to rebuild the container when I make changes to the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Conclusion

That's it. I hope you find this useful.

And remember, while Pieter is busy counting his cash, here you are counting the number of successful builds.
