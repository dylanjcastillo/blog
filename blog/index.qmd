Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dylan, the founder of [Iwana Labs](https://iwanalabs.com).

I've been working with AI for the [past 8 years](https://linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo) and am an [open-source contributor](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo). I've delivered projects for large-scale corporations, government agencies, and startups. 

I'm currently freelancing as an AI engineer at [REMATIQ](https://rematiq.com) and working on [Namemancer](https://namemancer.com).

## Posts

This collection features my longer posts on AI, Data Science, programming, and occasional personal topics like yearly reviews or random thoughts.

## TIL

Inspired by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/til/), I've started a collection of short, mostly technical posts to help me remember things. Lowering the bar for post development lets me post more often and remember better.
