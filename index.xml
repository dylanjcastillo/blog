  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is my annual review. I use it as a way to reflect on the past year and get a snapshot of “who I am” at the time of writing.</p>
<p>If it’s me rereading this, welcome back. This is Dylan from 2024.</p>
<p>In previous snapshots, I listed what went well and what didn’t. This year, I’m trying something new: a chronological approach. 2024 went through three distinct phases, and I found it easier to reflect on each one.</p>
<section id="early-2024" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="early-2024">Early 2024</h2>
<p>This was my “I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do” phase.</p>
<p>In my last snapshot, I said that I was going to focus on building a consulting practice in 2024. Then I came up with a new product idea 😅 and spent a big chunk of the first two months of the year building a prototype.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">At least I generated some cool AI book covers.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><a href="https://aitheneum.iwanalabs.com/">AItheneum</a><sup>1</sup> is a tool that helps you read classic philosophy books by making them easier to understand using AI. I pitched it as a way to make classic books more accessible to modern readers.</p>
<p>I had fun working on it, but it wasn’t really solving anyone’s problem. It was a vitamin, not a painkiller. By the time I released it, it was clear nobody cared about it (not even me!).</p>
<p>During this time, I was also contributing to <a href="https://github.com/django-components/django-components">django-components</a> and half-assing talking to potential clients for freelance work and doing cold outreach to get clients. The former was fun, the latter wasn’t.</p>
<p>Later in the year, after reading Alex Hormozi’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/100M-Leads-Strangers-Stuff-Acquisition-com-ebook/dp/B0CFDR3TYV">100M Leads</a>, I realized that cold outreach at this stage was mostly a waste of time. When you’re just starting out, you should rely on warm introductions or referrals. If you haven’t built credibility yet, you’ll waste a lot of time trying to convince strangers to work with you.</p>
<p>I essentially spent the first two months of the year focusing on the wrong things.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I was also doing open mic sets almost every week. I’m not sure if this was “good”, but I had a lot of fun performing stand-up comedy.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><a href="images/2024-personal-snapshot/jokes.webp" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2" title="My last stand-up set"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/2024-personal-snapshot/jokes.webp" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="My last stand-up set"></a></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">My last stand-up set</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As you might expect, I bombed a few times. But I also had a few good sets. A professional (but not famous) comedian even invited me to open for him at a show in a nearby city. I didn’t go, but it was flattering.</p>
<p>One thing that surprised me about stand-up comedy is that it follows a somewhat scientific process. Your joke is a hypothesis about what your audience will find funny. You test it by performing it in front of people. If it doesn’t work, you adjust it and test it again. You do this over and over until you find something that works.</p>
<p>The other thing I liked about it is that it’s very meritocratic. If you’re funny, you’ll get laughs. There’s no way to fake it. It’s very easy to figure out who’s good and who’s not. You might not like someone’s style, but if they’re good you cannot deny it.</p>
<p>However, after a few months, I realized it wasn’t sustainable:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To get good at stand-up, you have to make time for it. That means writing everyday, and performing as often as possible.</li>
<li>Open mics take a lot of time. To practice an 8 minute set, I’d often have to commute for 1 hour and stay for 1-2 hours of show (during which I did my 8 minutes).</li>
<li>As a beginner, you’ll only get spots during weekday evenings. Which isn’t great if you want to get enough sleep to be productive the next day.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even so, I didn’t fully decide to quit until we had a health crisis at home. My wife and I weren’t prioritizing our health in the first months of the year, and it took its toll.</p>
<p>Stand-up was fun, but it was distracting me from more important things. So I stopped.</p>
<p>I’m not sad or regretful about it, I’m happy that I’ve tried it and that I’ve learned that it’s not what I want to do right now. I’d love to return to it in the future, once I have less pressing things to focus on.</p>
</section>
<section id="mid-2024" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mid-2024">Mid 2024</h2>
<p>This was the “work hard and mental health struggles” phase.</p>
<p>I worked with clients on AI projects in various industries, including legal, construction, consumer packaged goods, and finance. I also started blogging again.</p>
<p>I frequently put in 12-hour workdays and worked most weekends. I stopped going to the gym, and switched to home workouts. I rarely went to social events. Life passed by rapidly, and looking back, it all feels like a blur.</p>
<p>I struggled with my mental health. I experienced episodes of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Depression has been part of my life for the past twenty years. Though, I’m much better at dealing with it than I used to be. I’ve learned to recognize early warning signs and adjust my approach accordingly.</p>
<p>For that reason, I try to keep track of the “bad days”. Because when they occur too often, my brain is telling me I should take action. During this phase of the year, I had a lot more of those than I’d like.</p>
<p>Eventually, things settled down. I became more conscious of my own limits. I learned to regulate the intensity I put into things. I could push myself hard when I needed to, but also learned to feel comfortable with taking a break and not do anything when I needed to.</p>
<p>I also met some clients in person. While I’m a fan of remote work, seeing people face to face makes you more empathetic toward the people you’re working with. This was a lot more fun than I expected.</p>
<p>During this time I also hired external support to help me develop some of my product ideas and support my consulting work.</p>
</section>
<section id="late-2024" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="late-2024">Late 2024</h2>
<p>This was the “force myself to stay focused and in motion” phase.</p>
<p>The last few months were still intense, but less focused. I was working with clients while also making time to think about the future. I had a few moments of “what if I drop the consulting thing and go back to product development?”, but decided against it every time.</p>
<p>I did more sales outreach, managed multiple projects, and kept writing blog posts. I wrote a <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/say-what-you-mean-sometimes.html">post about using Structured Outputs in LLMs</a> and fixed a security vulnerability in a <a href="https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor/pull/1168">Python package</a> that gets more than 1M downloads per month.</p>
<p>I also traveled to Venezuela for the first time in eight years. It was both wonderful and unsettling.</p>
<p>During the first week of the trip, we stayed in a nice hotel in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_Island">Margarita</a>, with great food, gym, pools, and a private beach. But if you talked with anyone working at the hotel, you’d learn they were making less than $200/month and did not routinely have access to clean water or electricity. After almost a decade of living in Europe, it felt strange to witness once again such a disparity.</p>
<p>I also met old friends and family there. It made me nostalgic for my childhood and university days, but it also made me realize how much I’ve changed since then. When I was a teenager, I often thought I might end up alone and without friends, as I had extreme social anxiety. Now I’m married, have a great group of friends, and can even tell jokes in public!</p>
<p>After I came back from Venezuela, I started going through more academic research and refreshing my <a href="https://mathacademy.com/">math skills</a>. I’ve always felt that some of my base math skills were lacking and I wanted to fix that. So far, it’s going great.</p>
<p>My father-in-law also moved with us for this part of the year. It was a big change for us, but it’s been a great experience.</p>

<p>I don’t like taking pictures, but looking back, I regret not capturing more key moments from the year. That’s a small lesson I’ll take into next year.</p>
</section>
<section id="lessons-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The three biggest lessons I took away from 2024 are focus, intensity, and action.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> is about figuring out what are the right things to prioritize. It’s easy to say that, but it’s hard to do. Life is full of distractions, and it’s easy to get lost in the noise.</p>
<p>When I’m not sure what to do, I use one heuristic that works well: I prioritize things that will help me on my way regardless of their outcome. For example, if I dedicate more time to writing technical posts, I learn through the act of writing, but I also attract clients who are interested in those posts. The same with sales: I might not get a client from a sales call, but I learn a lot about the process and get better at it. So, regardless of the outcome, I win.</p>
<p><strong>Intensity</strong> is about working hard and taking ownership. This year I handled more work than ever. My brain fought back. At times I felt anxious, depressed, out of energy, and unable to focus. Eventually, my brain accepted that I wouldn’t back down. It stopped fighting against me and began working for me.</p>
<p>It’s not pretty. It’s deeply uncomfortable. But it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong> is about staying in motion. Being too busy is better than being too idle. When you’re busy, you’re constantly learning, forced to prioritize, and often become more creative under pressure.</p>
<p>I used to think that being “too busy” would prevent me from focusing on the right things. But I eventually realized it was the other way around. The busier I got, the clearer my priorities became. I learned more, and the better I became at what I was doing, the more time I had for the things I really wanted to do.</p>
<p>Being busy made me better and more productive.</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>I’ve realized I’m not great at predicting what I’ll want to do, nor am I a great planner.</p>
<p>Right now, my biggest priority is growing my consulting practice. I also finally found a painkiller product idea that I’ve been slowly working on. If I find enough traction, I’ll pivot to it. But until then, my focus is on consulting.</p>
<p>The only thing I’m sure is that I’ll keep myself busy.</p>

  <title>The good, the bad, and the ugly of Gemini’s structured outputs</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/posts/gemini-structured-outputs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>For a long time, I didn’t pay much attention to the idea that structured outputs could have an impact on the performance of LLMs. But after reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442">Let Me Speak Freely?</a> and <a href="https://blog.dottxt.co/say-what-you-mean.html">.txt’s rebuttal</a>, I started to question my assumptions.</p>
<p>I decided to run some benchmarks myself using popular proprietary models, starting with <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/say-what-you-mean-sometimes.html"><em>GPT-4o-mini</em></a>. During my analysis, I found that structured outputs did, in fact, decrease performance on some tasks.</p>
<p>After that, I was curious to see if the same was true for <em>Gemini 1.5 Flash</em>. This time, the answer wasn’t so straightforward, which is why I decided to write a separate post about it. In the process, I ran into an issue in Gemini’s Generative AI SDK that can break your application if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll share the results from running various benchmarks for <em>Gemini 1.5 Flash</em> comparing structured and unstructured outputs and the learnings I had along the way.</p>
<p>You can find the full code to run the benchmarks in this <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/blog/tree/main/_extras/gemini-structured-outputs">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Google recently released a new <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai">Python SDK for Gemini</a>, which seems to address the automatically sorting keys issue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you’re in a hurry, here are my key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The good</strong>: Overall, Gemini’s structured outputs performed on par with unstructured outputs.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li><strong>The bad</strong>: This only holds for the less rigid interpretation of “structured outputs”. When testing constrained decoding specifically, Gemini’s structured outputs performed worse than unstructured outputs.</li>
<li><strong>The ugly</strong>: Function calling and constrained decoding have a big design flaw. The order of the keys specified in the schema is not preserved when using the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/">Generative AI Python SDK</a>. This will break chain-of-thought reasoning in your applications unless you use a workaround (that only works for constrained decoding).</li>

<p>The figure above compares the performance of Gemini’s structured outputs to unstructured outputs. <strong>NL</strong> stands for <em>Natural Language</em>, which means the model writes the output in a free-form manner. In contrast, <strong>JSON-Prompt</strong> and <strong>JSON-Schema</strong> involve structured outputs that follow a predefined JSON schema.</p>
<p>For <strong>JSON-Prompt</strong>, the JSON schema is included in the prompt, instructing the model to generate JSON formatted output based on its MIME type configuration. <strong>JSON-Schema</strong> works similarly, but the schema is set directly in the model’s configuration instead of being included in the prompt.</p>
<p>When considering both <strong>JSON-Prompt</strong> and <strong>JSON-Schema</strong>, Gemini’s structured outputs performed comparably to unstructured outputs. However, with <strong>JSON-Schema</strong> alone (i.e., constrained decoding), performance drops compared to unstructured outputs. This difference is most evident in the <em>Shuffled Objects</em> task, where <strong>NL</strong> achieved a score of 97.15%, while <strong>JSON-Schema</strong> scored 86.18%.</p>

<p>In case you’re not familiar with the concept, structured outputs are a group of methods that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07362">“ensure that the model outputs adhere to a specific structure”</a>. In Open weight models, a <em>structure</em> can mean anything from a JSON schema to a specific regex pattern. With proprietary models, it usually means a JSON schema.</p>
<p>In its less rigid interpretation, this includes any method that can generate LLM outputs adhering to a structured format, such as prompting, <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">function calling</a>, <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#json-mode">JSON mode</a>, or <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/">constrained decoding</a>.</p>
<p>In its more rigid interpretation, this includes only constrained decoding, as it is the only method that will guarantee the output adheres to the schema you provide.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="study-design">Study design</h2>
<p>In Let Me Speak Freely?, Tam et al.&nbsp;evaluated structured and unstructured outputs across three reasoning tasks and six classification tasks. They used exact match to evaluate the reasoning tasks and accuracy to evaluate the classification tasks. They ran the experiments using the following models:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Proprietary models</strong>: <em>gpt-3.5-turbo-0125</em>, <em>claude-3-haiku-20240307</em>, <em>gemini-1.5-flash</em>, and <em>gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Open-weight models</strong>: <em>LLaMA3-8B-Instruct</em>, and <em>Gemma-2-9B-Instruct</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this article, I just focused on <em>Gemini 1.5 Flash</em> and the reasoning tasks. I already ran the benchmarks for <em>GPT-4o-mini</em> and <em>Llama3-8B-Instruct</em> in my <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/say-what-you-mean-sometimes.html">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>I excluded the classification tasks because I believe structured outputs perform better in classification tasks, and this is also in line with the study’s original findings. So I just focused on the three reasoning tasks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k">GSM8K</a>: A dataset from of grade school math word problems.</li>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChilleD/LastLetterConcat">Last Letter</a>: A dataset of simple word puzzles that require concatening the last letters of a list of names.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/tracking_shuffled_objects">Shuffled Objects</a>: A dataset that requires reasoning about the state of a system after a sequence of shuffling operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the article details the process of re-evaluating these benchmarks using <em>Gemini-1.5-Flash</em>.</p>

<section id="structured-outputs-with-gemini" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structured-outputs-with-gemini">Structured outputs with Gemini</h2>
<p>Gemini has three ways of generating structured outputs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/tutorials/extract_structured_data"><strong>Forced function calling (FC)</strong></a>: You force the model to call a “function” and that makes the model generate a JSON schema that matches the function’s arguments.</li>
<li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output?lang=python#supply-schema-in-prompt"><strong>Schema in prompt (JSON-Prompt)</strong></a>: You include a JSON schema in the prompt, specify <code>mime_type='application/json'</code> and the model generates a response that matches the schema.</li>
<li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output?lang=python#supply-schema-in-config"><strong>Schema in model configuration (JSON-Schema)</strong></a>: You provide a JSON schema in the model configuration, specify <code>mime_type='application/json'</code> in the request and the model generates a response that matches the schema. This is the only method that seems to use <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/mastering-controlled-generation-with-gemini-15-schema-adherence/">controlled generation</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve included <em>JSON-Prompt</em> and <em>JSON-Schema</em> in the analysis, but had to exclude <em>FC</em> because it’s not possible to use it for chain-of-thought reasoning, which is a requirement for the benchmarks.</p>
</section>
<section id="issues-with-geminis-structured-outputs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="issues-with-geminis-structured-outputs">Issues with Gemini’s structured outputs</h2>
<p>When running the three benchmarks, I quickly ran into a performance issue with <em>FC</em> and <em>JSON-Schema</em>. In all tasks, both showed double-digit performance drops compared to <em>NL</em>.</p>
<p>This didn’t make a lot of sense, so I started investigating.</p>
<p>I was using the following response schema for all structured outputs:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;

font-style: inherit;">class</span> Response(BaseModel):</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    reasoning: <span class="bu" style="color: null;

<span id="cb1-3">    answer: <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">str</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The prompts were similar to the one below, adjusted according to the task:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are an expert in solving grade school math tasks. You will be presented with a grade-school math word problem and be asked to solve it.</p>
<p>You will always respond with JSON matching the following schema:</p>

<p>First, provide your step by step reasoning in the “reasoning” field. Then, in the “answer” field, provide your final answer. Don’t include any other text in the “answer” field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I eventually realized that the performance drop in <em>JSON-Schema</em> was due to the keys in the schema being reversed when generating the response. I then noticed that Tam et al.&nbsp;briefly mentioned in Let Me Speak Freely? that <em>JSON-Schema</em> responses failed to produce valid JSON due to this exact problem, so they did not include it in their analysis.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to exclude it from the analysis, so I started looking for a way to control the order of the keys in the schema. I found that the order of the keys in the schema gets sorted alphabetically before the response is generated. To confirm this, I ran a test with 100 randomly generated schemas. Every resulting output had its keys sorted alphabetically, so it’s clear this is not by chance.</p>
<p>I also found that the Vertex AI documentation mentions a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/control-generated-output"><code>propertyOrdering</code></a> parameter, which should allow control over the order of keys. However, this feature <a href="https://discuss.ai.google.dev/t/issue-with-key-ordering-in-controlled-generation-on-gemini-1-5/41737/3">doesn’t appear</a> <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-python/issues/533">to work</a> with the Generative AI Python SDK.</p>
<p>Unable to use the <code>propertyOrdering</code> parameter, I resorted to a quick workaround: I named the keys in a way that forced the desired order alphabetically. Instead of using <code>reasoning</code> and <code>answer</code>, I used <code>reasoning</code> and <code>solution</code>. This preserved the chain-of-thought reasoning in the responses, and resolved the performance drop in <em>JSON-Schema</em>.</p>
<p>But <em>FC</em> was a different story. Unlike <em>JSON-Schema</em>, the order of the keys follow a less predictable pattern, and I couldn’t find a way to control it. So I decided to exclude <em>FC</em> from the analysis.</p>

<p>Using a 0-shot prompt and 3-shot prompts, I was able to improve all the metrics on the tasks and methods Tam et al.&nbsp;used for their benchmarks. Which is great!</p>
<p><em>NL</em> and <em>JSON-Prompt</em> are tied, without a clear winner between them. Each method got a slight edge over in 3 out of 6 tasks. On the other hand, <em>JSON-Schema</em> performed worst than <em>NL</em> in 5 out of 6 tasks. Plus, in <em>Shuffled Objects</em>, it did so with a gap of more than 10 percentage points: 97.15% for <em>NL</em> vs.&nbsp;86.18% for <em>JSON-Schema</em>.</p>
<p>Tam et al.&nbsp;defined structured outputs as any method that “involves providing output in standardized formats like JSON or XML through format restriction.” which is in line with the less rigid interpretation of structured outputs. Using this definition, the results show no performance gap between structured and unstructured outputs. This directly contradicts the study’s original claim.</p>
<p>But if you take the also common interpretation that constrained decoding is the only form of structured generation, then the study’s original conclusion still applies: there is indeed a significant performance gap between structured and unstructured outputs.</p>
<p>Weird, I know. But that’s the way it is.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Results are mixed for Gemini 1.5 Flash.</p>
<p>The good news is that structured outputs perform on par with unstructured ones. The bad news is that this only holds if you adopt the more flexible definition of “structured outputs.” And the ugly news is that Gemini’s Generative AI SDK has a major issue in how it handles the order of keys in the provided schema.</p>
<p>Based on the results, I’d suggest the following when using Gemini:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Avoid FC for any tasks that require chain-of-thought reasoning.</li>
<li>Default to JSON-Prompt over JSON-Schema for reasoning tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I want to emphasize that I love working with structured outputs. They save a lot of time. But I know there are tasks where they might perform worse (or better!) than unstructured outputs. There’s not enough evidence to support one or the other, so what I should just run my own evals and decide based on that.</p>
<p>That’s the real takeaway: run your own evals and choose the approach that works best for you. Don’t blindly trust random posts online.</p>

  <title>Structured outputs can hurt the performance of LLMs</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/posts/say-what-you-mean-sometimes.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>When I read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442">Let Me Speak Freely?</a> by Tam et al.&nbsp;I thought they raised an interesting question: does constraining LLM outputs to structured formats impact the quality of their responses?</p>
<p>In both the original study and their recent update, Tam et al.&nbsp;concluded that is the case. They found that “structured generation constraints significantly impact LLM performance across various tasks”.</p>
<p>But the study had major flaws. The <a href="https://dottxt.co/">.txt</a> team wrote a very compelling <a href="https://dottxt.co/blog/let-me-speak-freely">rebuttal</a> to the paper. For <em>Llama-3-8B-Instruct</em>, they demonstrate that Tam, et al.&nbsp;results were mostly due to poor prompting, unfair comparisons and the improper use of an “AI parser” rather than the use of structured outputs.</p>
<p>I liked the rebuttal but it still left me wondering how well their results generalize. They focused on a single model<sup>1</sup>, which represents a small fraction of the LLMs powering applications in production today. Open-weight models offer more flexibility on how to <em>structure</em> your output, such as letting users specify <a href="https://dottxt-ai.github.io/outlines/latest/reference/generation/regex/">regex expressions</a> to constrain the output. Proprietary models lack this. Right now, JSON is the only structured output format guaranteed to work across most popular providers.</p>
<p>Given this constraint, would the .txt team’s results still hold?</p>
<p>Plus, both the original study and the rebuttal focused on tasks that might not be a good proxy for the full range of tasks people use LLMs for. Would the rebuttal results be different in settings outside of simple reasoning tasks?</p>
<p>So I decided to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Replicate the results from .txt’s rebuttal using <em>LLaMA3-8B-Instruct</em>.</li>
<li>Replicate the same tasks using a proprietary model <em>GPT-4o-mini</em>.</li>
<li>Test results on a broader set of tasks such as <a href="https://livebench.ai/">LiveBench</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article presents the results of the first two steps. All the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/blog/tree/main/_extras/say-what-you-mean-sometimes">Github</a>.</p>
<section id="results" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>If you’re short on time, here are the key findings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tam et al.’s conclusions about structured outputs might still hold, even if they did not properly test for it. There are tasks where structured outputs perform worse than unstructured ones.</li>
<li>.txt’s rebuttal is accurate. It shows that structured outputs are as good or better than unstructured outputs for <em>LLaMA3-8B-Instruct</em> in the tasks considered. But a similar approach did not hold for <em>GPT-4o-mini</em> (and possibly other models).</li>
</ol>
<p>The figure below shows the results for <em>GPT-4o-mini</em> using .txt’s prompt fixes, along with additional improvements I made.</p>

<p>For <strong>GSM8K</strong> and <strong>Last Letter</strong>, structured and unstructured methods scored similarly. But for <strong>Shuffled Objects</strong>, unstructured outputs clearly surpassed a structured format.</p>

<p>Tam et al.&nbsp;evaluated structured and unstructured outputs across three reasoning tasks and six classification tasks. They used exact match to evaluate the reasoning tasks and accuracy to evaluate the classification tasks. They ran the experiments using the following models:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Proprietary models</strong>: <em>gpt-3.5-turbo-0125</em>, <em>claude-3-haiku-20240307</em>, <em>gemini-1.5-flash</em>, and <em>gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Open-weight models</strong>: <em>LLaMA3-8B-Instruct</em>, and <em>Gemma-2-9B-Instruct</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>.txt used a similar setup, but only focused on the reasoning tasks using <em>LLaMA3-8B-Instruct</em>. They did not include classification tasks because Tam et al.&nbsp;observed that structured outputs resulted in better performance in these tasks, so there was no need to test for it.</p>
<p>I also believe that structured outputs are better for classification tasks. So, I excluded them from my analysis as well.</p>
<p>The reasoning tasks were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k">GSM8K</a>: A dataset from of grade school math word problems.</li>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChilleD/LastLetterConcat">Last Letter</a>: A dataset of simple word puzzles that require concatening the last letters of a list of names.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/tracking_shuffled_objects">Shuffled Objects</a>: A dataset that requires reasoning about the state of a system after a sequence of shuffling operations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Except for <strong>Structured</strong> in the <strong>Shuffled Objects</strong> task, I was able to improve all the metrics. In <strong>GSM8K’s</strong> case, even reversing .txt’s result, with <strong>Unstructured</strong> outperforming <strong>Structured</strong> by a small margin.</p>
<p>But I don’t think this matters much.</p>
<p>Their conclusion still holds: structured outputs are either as good as or better than unstructured outputs, in the tasks considered.</p>
<p>I’ll explain the prompt changes I made below, so that you can judge for yourself if they make sense.</p>
<section id="formatting-few-shot-examples" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formatting-few-shot-examples">Formatting few-shot examples</h3>
<p>In the <strong>GSM8K</strong> and <strong>Last Letter</strong> tasks, the few-shot prompt for both unstructured and structured used examples formatted as JSON objects and asked the LLM to produce the output in the same format, from which the answer was extracted.</p>
<p>That felt unfair. Even though you’re not formally constraining the LLM to produce a JSON object, you’re still asking it to format its response in somewhat unnatural way.</p>
<p>I adjusted the prompts to be as similar as possible for both unstructured and structured outputs while still trying to get the most out of each approach.</p>
<p>For example, in <strong>GSM8K</strong>, the unstructured prompt is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are an expert in solving grade school math tasks. You will be presented with a grade-school math word problem and be asked to solve it. You will always respond in the following format:</p>
<p>&lt;str, reasoning about the answer&gt;</p>
<p>ANSWER: &lt;int, final answer&gt;</p>
<p>First, provide your step by step reasoning. Then, in ANSWER, provide an integer that corresponds to the correct answer to the question. Don’t include any other text in ANSWER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the structured prompt is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are an expert in solving grade school math tasks. You will be presented with a grade-school math word problem and be asked to solve it. You will always respond in the following format:</p>
<p>{“reasoning”: &lt;str, reasoning about the answer&gt;, “answer”: &lt;int, final answer&gt;}</p>
<p>First, provide your step by step reasoning in the “reasoning” field. Then, in the “answer” field, provide an integer that corresponds to the correct answer to the question. Don’t include any other text in the “answer” field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, for all the tasks, I used a 3-shot prompt.</p>
</section>
<section id="clarifying-the-task" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clarifying-the-task">Clarifying the task</h3>
<p>I also tried to make the prompts clearer. The description of the task in the original <strong>Last Letter</strong> prompt was:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are an expert in solving simple word puzzles using reasoning steps. Your specific task is going to be to take a list of 4 names and reason about the last letter of each ., then you will concatenate those letters into a word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I changed it to:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are an expert in solving word puzzles. Your specific task is going to be to take a list of 4 names, get the last letter of each and concatenate these letters into a word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original prompt was reasonable, but I thought the new version was clearer. Through trial and error, I’ve learned that when working with LLMs, it’s best to be as clear and direct as possible.</p>

<p><em>NL</em> stands for “Natural Language”, which would correspond to the <em>Unstructured</em> method in the previous table.</p>
<p><em>FRI</em> stands for “Format Restricting Instructions”, which is a JSON generated through the OpenAI’s <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">function calling</a>. <em>JSON-Mode</em> is a JSON generated through the OpenAI’s <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#json-mode">JSON mode</a>. <em>JSON-Schema</em> is a JSON generated using <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/">constrained decoding</a>.</p>
<p><em>JSON-Schema</em> is the closest equivalent to <strong>Structured</strong> as referenced in the previous table. But, in real-life applications, you don’t really care about how the output was generated. You just want to get the output in the format you want. So, for the sake of comparison, I will consider the three other methods equivalent to <strong>Structured</strong> as well.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adjusting-for-proprietary-models">Adjusting for proprietary models</h3>
<p>In this case, I allowed for 3 retries in the case of parsing errors. I allowed for this because function calling had high error rates in the zero-shot prompting scenario.</p>
<p>These retries primarily affected <strong>FRI</strong> results. This might make the comparisons in <strong>Last Letter</strong> biased in favor of structured outputs (<strong>FRI</strong> was the best method in this case). But since <strong>JSON-Schema</strong> also outperformed <strong>NL</strong> in this case, this adjustment does not alter the overall conclusions. The other methods maintained error rates of &lt;0.5% in <strong>GSM8K</strong> and 0% in <strong>Last Letter</strong> and <strong>Shuffled Objects</strong>.</p>
<p>I used slightly different parsing functions for <strong>Unstructured</strong> and <strong>Structured</strong> outputs. The <strong>Unstructured</strong> parser was more lenient, removing commas and periods at the end of responses. But I believe this remains a fair comparison given that in the <strong>Structured</strong> cases you provide a JSON schema which is more informative.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyzing-the-results">Analyzing the results</h3>
<p>Similar to what the .txt team found, after adjusting the prompts, the performance of structured outputs increases substantially compared to Tam et al.</p>
<p>Except for <em>NL</em> in <strong>GSM8k</strong> and <em>FRI</em> in <strong>Last Letter</strong>, I was able to improve all the metrics for both unstructured and structured outputs using a 0-shot prompt. For 3-shot prompts, I improved <strong>GSM8k</strong> and <strong>Last Letter</strong> across all methods, and <em>NL</em> in <strong>Shuffled Objects</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>GSM8k</strong> and <strong>Last Letter</strong>, the results were very similar between unstructured and structured outputs. There was a slight edge for unstructured outputs in <strong>GSM8k</strong> and for structured outputs in <strong>Last Letter</strong>. In these cases, it’s not clear that one approach definitively outperforms the other.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>Shuffled Objects</strong> shows a clear advantage for unstructured outputs over structured outputs. This was unexpected, and even after tweaking the prompts, I couldn’t fully close the gap.</p>
<p>Despite the issues in Tam et al.’s study, their conclusion appears to hold. In this particular scenario, using a fairly popular model with reasonable prompts, there is a significant difference in performance between structured and unstructured outputs.</p>

<p>In <strong>GSM8k</strong> and <strong>Last Letter</strong>, few-shot prompting generally decreased performance. This is in line with <a href="https://python.useinstructor.com/blog/2024/09/26/bad-schemas-could-break-your-llm-structured-outputs/?h=bad+sc#modes-and-models">other analyses</a>.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You’re here because you want to know whether to use structured or unstructured outputs. As a developer, I’m glad to say the answer is: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orlybooks/comments/50meb5/it_depends/">it depends</a>.</p>
<p>I love using structured outputs in my daily work, because it makes it much easier to work with the output of LLMs. I always encourage <a href="https://iwanalabs.com/">clients</a> who aren’t using them yet to give them a try.</p>
<p>That said, until there’s stronger evidence showing that both approaches are equivalent, the best course of action is to test things for yourself. Run your own <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/">evals</a> and make a decision based on data.</p>
<p>I expect that in most cases, structured outputs will have similar performance to unstructured outputs. But, if you blindly assume that structured outputs are always equal to or better than unstructured ones, you might be missing out on easy performance gains.</p>
<p>Take the example of <strong>Shuffled Objects</strong> with <em>GPT-4o-mini</em>. You could potentially reduce the gap between the two methods by continuing improving the prompts or by switching to a more powerful model. But the costs, in terms of time and effort, might be more than simply switching to unstructured outputs.</p>
<p>And this cuts both ways. Unstructured outputs aren’t inherently better or worse than structured ones. Again, the right choice depends on your task, the model, and your prompt engineering skills. Test both approaches, identify if there are differences, and choose what works best.</p>

  <title>Transform any image to WebP from the terminal</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I was annoyed by the file size of my photo in the <a href="https://dylanjcastillo.com/about/">About page</a>, because it was slowing down the page load.</p>
<p>Is it important? No.</p>
<p>Don’t I have better things to do on a Saturday afternoon? Yes.</p>
<p>But it’s like going to bed with the closet door open—you know there’s nothing in there, but you just can’t shake the feeling that the devil (or <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diosdado_Cabello">Diosdado Cabello</a>) might jump out and kill you in your sleep unless you get up and shut it.</p>
<p>So I got o1-mini to write a simple script for me, and thought others might find it useful.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

<p>If you’re using MacOS, you first need to install <code>ffmpeg</code> using Homebrew:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">brew</span> install ffmpeg</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can add it to your <code>.zshrc</code> and use it by running <code>img2webp &lt;path_to_image&gt; [quality]</code>.</p>
<p>Just as reference, keeping the same quality, I decreased my profile picture from 234KB to 36KB by just changing from PNG to WebP.</p>
<p>Hope you found this useful.</p>

  <title>Structured outputs: don’t put the cart before the horse</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/posts/llm-pydantic-order-matters.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Not long ago, you couldn’t reliably ask an LLM to provide you with a response using a specific format. Building tools that used LLM outputs was painful.</p>
<p>Then, through <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">function calling</a> and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">structured outputs</a>, we could instruct LLMs to respond in specific formats<sup>1</sup>. So, extracting information from LLM outputs stopped being a problem.</p>
<p>But then I started noticing that structured outputs also had their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442">own set</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06988">of problems</a>. Most importantly, the apparent rigidity of a Pydantic model can make you forget that underneath, you’re still dealing with an LLM. Setting up a response model for your API calls is not the same as setting up a response model for your LLM outputs.</p>
<p>For example, take the following question from the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/reasoning">LiveBench</a> dataset:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Suppose I have a physical, solid, equilateral triangle, and I make two cuts. The two cuts are from two parallel lines, and both cuts pass through the interior of the triangle. How many pieces are there after the cuts? Think step by step, and then put your answer in <strong>bold</strong> as a single integer (for example, <strong>0</strong>). If you don’t know, guess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s say I write a simple system prompt and two Pydantic models to format the responses:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1">system_prompt <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">{response_format}</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">)</span>
<span id="cb1-6"></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">class</span> ResponseFormatA(BaseModel):</span>
<span id="cb1-8">    reasoning: <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">str</span></span>
<span id="cb1-9">    answer: <span class="bu" style="color: null;

<span id="cb1-10"></span>
<span id="cb1-11"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;

font-style: inherit;">class</span> ResponseFormatB(BaseModel):</span>
<span id="cb1-12">    answer: <span class="bu" style="color: null;

<span id="cb1-13">    reasoning: <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">str</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Do you think that there will be a difference in performance between <code>ResponseFormatA</code> and <code>ResponseFormatB</code>? If so, which one do you think will perform better?</p>
<p>Not sure? Well, you’re in luck! Let’s run some experiments to find out.</p>

<p>This will set up all the necessary infrastructure to run the experiments. I like using <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a> to track <a href="https://smith.langchain.com/public/11545ceb-70d3-4213-9f05-89891586b809/r?runtab=0">runs</a>.</p>
<p>To run the experiment, you need some data. I ended up using a subset of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/livebench/reasoning">reasoning questions</a> from LiveBench. You can download it and save it in the <code>data</code> directory.</p>
<p>Then, you can read it into a pandas <code>DataFrame</code>:</p>

<p>In this code, <code>validate_response</code> is used to check if the response is valid (i.e.&nbsp;it matches the JSON schema in the same order). If it is, it returns the response. Otherwise, it raises an exception.</p>
<p><code>extract_answer</code> is used to remove ** from the answer if it exists in the response. Some of the questions in the LiveBench dataset included instructions to put the answer in bold, which is why we need to remove it.</p>
<p><code>process_row</code> is used to process a single row of the DataFrame. It sends the system prompt to the LLM and validates the response. It includes a simple retry mechanism in case the validation fails. Each run is tracked in LangSmith.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>main</code> is used to run the experiment. It runs the <code>process_row</code> function concurrently for each row in the DataFrame.</p>

<p>Then, you can build bootstrap confidence intervals for the accuracies of the two response formats. Given that I’m asking the LLM the same question multiple times, I went with an approach called <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5965657/">cluster bootstrapping</a>, which accounts for the fact that the data points are not independent.</p>
<p>It should take a few seconds to run. Once it’s done, you should see output like the following:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Response Format</th>
<th>Accuracy (95% CI)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td>46.67% (35.33% – 58.00%)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>B</td>
<td>33.33% (22.67% – 44.67%)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These results suggest that the order of the fields in the JSON schema does matter.</p>
<p>But if you’re still unsure, you can perform a t-test to see if the two response formats are statistically different:</p>

<p>I got a p-value &lt;0.01, meaning I can reject the null hypothesis that the two response formats are the same.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on the results of the experiment, we can safely say that <code>ResponseFormatA</code> is better than <code>ResponseFormatB</code>.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>In this case, it’s simple.</p>
<p>These response formats are meant to help the LLM reason step by step to arrive at the answer. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_thought_reasoning">chain of thought reasoning</a>. However, for it to work, we need the LLM to first provide us with the reasoning of how it arrived at the answer and then the answer.</p>
<p>In <code>ResponseFormatA</code>, we defined our Pydantic model with the reasoning first and the answer second. This means that the LLM will give us the reasoning first, and then provide the answer. Which is exactly what we want.</p>
<p><code>ResponseFormatB</code> works in the opposite way. This means that the LLM will give us the answer first, and then provide the reasoning. So our chain of thought reasoning becomes a <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/zeroshot">zero-shot prompt</a>. In this case, the reasoning is a byproduct of the answer.</p>
<p>So, to summarize, when using structured outputs, don’t put the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>That’s all! Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.</p>

  <title>Deploying a FastAPI app with Kamal, AWS ECR, and Github Actions</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/posts/deploy-a-fastapi-app-with-kamal-aws-ecr-and-github-actions.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>These days I use Kamal to deploy my FastAPI (or Django) projects. Kamal is a simpler alternative to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> that you can use to deploy containerized apps to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a>.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, it’ll only take you a few minutes to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys your app to production with each push to the <em>main</em> branch.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through the process of deploying a FastAPI app with Kamal, AWS ECR, and Github Actions.</p>
<p>You can find the code for this tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/fastapi-kamal-aws-gha-example">this repository</a>.</p>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To make the most of this tutorial, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> app ready to deploy.</li>
<li>Have an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> account and its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html">CLI</a> installed.</li>
<li>Be comfortable with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">Kamal</a>. You’ll need to install version <code>1.9.0</code> for this tutorial.</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">Github Actions</a>.</li>
<li>Have a VPS with Ubuntu ready to host your app.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="prepare-your-vps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prepare-your-vps">Prepare your VPS</h2>
<p>You’ll need to install docker, curl, git, and snapd on your VPS, and create a non-root user called <code>kamal</code> that can sudo. You should also set the <code>UID</code> and <code>GID</code> of the user to 1000.</p>
<p>If you’re using Hetzner, you can use my <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/create-a-kamal-ready-vps-on-hetzner-using-terraform.html">terraform script</a> to prepare the VPS.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can run these commands on your VPS’s terminal:</p>

<p>To run these commands, you need to login as root. This assumes that there isn’t already a non-root user with <code>UID</code> 1000. Otherwise, you’ll have to adjust the commands accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, if you don’t have a public SSH key for the “Add SSH key” step, you can generate one with the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"your-email@example.com"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These commands will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install docker, curl, and git</li>
<li>Start and enable the docker service</li>
<li>Create a non-root user called kamal</li>
<li>Disable root login</li>
<li>Add the kamal user to the docker group (this allows the user to run docker without needing to use <code>sudo</code>)</li>
<li>Create a Docker bridge network for Traefik</li>
<li>Create a folder for the Let’s Encrypt ACME JSON file</li>
<li>Make the Let’s Encrypt ACME JSON folder writable by the kamal user</li>
<li>Restart the server</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, configure the SSH key in your local <code>.ssh/config</code> file so you can login as the kamal user without using the root account.</p>
<pre><code>Host kamal
  HostName &lt;YOUR_VPS_IP&gt;
  User kamal
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY&gt;</code></pre>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-a-dockerfile-for-your-fastapi-app">Create a Dockerfile for your FastAPI app</h2>
<p>Kamal works with containerized apps, so you’ll need to have a Dockerfile. I also recommend using an <code>entrypoint.sh</code> script to run the application, because that also allows you to run commands in the container.</p>

<p>This multi-stage Dockerfile does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Installs poetry and sets up the virtual environment</li>
<li>Creates the user <code>kamal</code> with the <code>UID</code> and <code>GID</code> 1000 and runs the application with that user.</li>
<li>Exposes port 8000 and runs the application by executing the <code>entrypoint.sh</code> script. Kamal automatically detects that is the port the app runs on and <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/kamal/issues/58">will use that to set up the reverse proxy</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to adjust this Dockerfile to your needs.</p>

It also allows you to pass other arguments to the script, which is useful if you want to run other commands in the container. You can add or remove commands to the script as needed.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll need a place to push and pull your Docker images. I use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS ECR</a>, so that’s what I’ll show you how to do here. Kamal also supports <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/configuration/docker-registry/">other registries</a>.</p>
<p>Log in to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">AWS Management Console</a> and go to Amazon ECR. Click on <code>Create repository</code> and set a name for your repository.</p>
<p>Then, create a new IAM user in your AWS account by going to Services &gt; IAM &gt; Users &gt; Add user.</p>
<p>During the process you’ll have to assign a permissions to the user. You can create a new policy with the following content and attach it to the user:</p>

<p>This policy enables users to list, access, and manage the ECR repository they have previously created, as well as obtain an authorization token necessary for pushing and pulling images. You must replace <code>&lt;REGION&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ACCOUNT_ID&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;REPOSITORY_NAME&gt;</code> with the specific details of your own repository.</p>
<p>Then, select the user you created and navigate to Security credentials &gt; Access keys &gt; Create access key. Download the generated CSV file and store it in a secure location.</p>
<p>The GitHub Actions workflow will use these credentials for pushing and pulling images from the ECR registry.</p>

<p>Open your FastAPI project in your favorite code editor. Create a folder called <code>deploy</code> in the root directory. Then go into the folder and initialize Kamal:</p>

<p>This will create two folders (<code>.kamal/</code> and <code>config/</code>) and an <code>.env</code> file. Inside <code>config/</code>, you’ll find a <code>deploy.yml</code> file. This is where you’ll provide the instructions for Kamal to build and deploy your app.</p>

<p>This will set up your app and a reverse proxy using Traefik (with automatic SSL certificates using Let’s Encrypt). Remember to replace the placeholders with your own values. It will also do a healthcheck on <code>/up</code> on port 8000.</p>
<section id="test-the-configuration-locally" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-the-configuration-locally">Test the configuration locally</h3>
<p>To test it locally, first, you must define the required environment variables in <code>.env</code>, such as keys for AI services, email providers, etc.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to get a temporary password to authenticate into the ECR registry. You can get this password by running the following command from your terminal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">aws</span> ecr get-login-password <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--region</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;</span>YOUR_REGION<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should copy the output of this command and paste it in the <code>KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD</code> field in the <code>.env</code> file.</p>
<p>Then, run the following command to deploy your application to your VPS:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">kamal</span> env push</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">kamal</span> deploy</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first command will push the environment variables to the VPS. The second command will build the Docker image, push it to the ECR registry, and deploy it to your VPS.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, your app should be live at <code>https://&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If you see any errors, you can:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Run <code>kamal app logs</code> to see the logs of the app.</li>
<li>Open a terminal in the container by running <code>kamal app exec -it bash</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how I usually debug the app.</p>

<p>This workflow will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Checkout the code</li>
<li>Set up the Ruby environment and install Kamal</li>
<li>Configure the AWS credentials</li>
<li>Login to the AWS ECR registry</li>
<li>Set up Docker Buildx for cache</li>
<li>Expose GitHub Runtime for cache</li>
<li>Create the <code>.env</code> file</li>
<li>Run Kamal deploy</li>
</ol>
<p>It will run everytime you make a push to the main branch or by manually triggering the workflow. It’ll cancel any in-progress runs to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>Also, before you push your code to the repository, you’ll need to add the following secrets to the repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY</code>: The private key to connect to your VPS</li>
<li><code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR</code>: The access key ID for the AWS ECR registry</li>
<li><code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR</code>: The secret access key for the AWS ECR registry</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, to speed up the deployment, add these options to the <code>builder</code> section of the <code>deploy.yml</code> file:</p>

<p>This will enable the Docker Buildx cache for the build process in Github Actions. You can set <code>multiarch</code> to <code>false</code> if your CI pipeline shares the same architecture as your VPS, which was the case for me.</p>

<p>You now have a fully automated deployment pipeline for your FastAPI app. A push to the <code>main</code> branch will trigger the workflow, that will build the Docker image, push it to the ECR registry, and deploy it to your VPS.</p>
<p>Break free from the tyranny of manual deployments and expensive cloud services. Sleep like a baby and let Kamal handle your deployments.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to leave a comment below.</p>

<p>Every other night, my wife wakes me up to tell me I’m muttering unintelligible phrases in my sleep: “restart nginx,” “the SSL certificate failed to validate,” or “how do I exit vim?”</p>
<p>I still suffer from PTSD from the days of manually deploying web apps. But since switching to Kamal, I’ve been sleeping like a baby<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Kamal is sort of a lightweight version of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> that you can use to deploy containerized apps to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a>. It has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it’ll take you less than 5 minutes to get an app in production with a CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>A single push to main, and that green GitHub Actions checkmark confirms that your 2-pixel padding change is live for the world to admire.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through the process of deploying a Django app with Kamal, AWS ECR, and Github Actions.</p>
<p>You can find the code for this tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/django-kamal-aws-gha-example">this repository</a>.</p>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To make the most of this tutorial, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> account and its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html">CLI</a> installed.</li>
<li>Be comfortable with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">Kamal</a>. You’ll need to install version <code>1.9.0</code> for this tutorial.</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">Github Actions</a>.</li>
<li>Have a VPS with Ubuntu ready to host your app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you should also have a Django project ready to deploy. But if you don’t have one, you can use this sample <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/django-kamal-aws-gha-example">Django project</a> for the tutorial.</p>

<section id="prepare-the-vps-for-kamal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prepare-the-vps-for-kamal">Prepare the VPS for Kamal</h2>
<p>At a minimum, you’ll need to install docker, curl, git, and snapd on your VPS, and create a non-root user called <code>kamal</code> that can sudo. That user should have a 1000 <code>UID</code> and <code>GID</code>.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/create-a-kamal-ready-vps-on-hetzner-using-terraform.html">terraform script</a> that will take care of this for you if you’re using Hetzner.</p>
<p>But if you’d like to do it manually, you can run these commands on your VPS’s terminal:</p>

<p>This assumes that you’re using a root user to connect to your server and that there isn’t a non-root user with <code>UID</code> 1000 already. Otherwise, adjust the commands accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, if you don’t have a public SSH key for the “Add SSH key” step, you can generate one with the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"your-email@example.com"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These commands will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install docker, curl, git, and snapd</li>
<li>Start and enable the docker service</li>
<li>Create a non-root user called kamal</li>
<li>Remove the root login</li>
<li>Add the kamal user to the docker group</li>
<li>Create a bridge network for Traefik, SQLite, and redis</li>
<li>Create a folder for the Let’s Encrypt ACME JSON</li>
<li>Make the Let’s Encrypt ACME JSON folder writable by the kamal user</li>
<li>Create a folder for the SQLite database and redis data</li>
<li>Make the SQLite database and redis data folders writable by the kamal user</li>
<li>Restart the server</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not using SQLite or redis, you can skip the database and redis data folder steps.</p>
<p>Finally, configure the SSH key in your local <code>.ssh/config</code> file so you can login as the kamal user without using the root account.</p>

<p>This is a multi-stage Dockerfile that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Installs poetry and sets up the virtual environment</li>
<li>Creates the user <code>django</code> with the <code>UID</code> and <code>GID</code> 1000 and runs the application with that user. It’s important that this user has the same <code>UID</code> and <code>GID</code> as the owner of the folders outside the container. Otherwise, you’ll have issues with <a href="https://medium.com/@nielssj/docker-volumes-and-file-system-permissions-772c1aee23ca">file permissions</a> and the app won’t persist data.</li>
<li>Exposes port 8000 and runs the application by executing the <code>entrypoint.sh</code> script. By exposing the port, Kamal will automatically detect that is the port the app runs on and <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/kamal/issues/58">will use that to set up the reverse proxy</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to adjust this Dockerfile to your needs. If you are not planning on using redis or a SQLite database in your same VPS, you can remove those parts from the Dockerfile.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll need a place to push and pull your Docker images. I like using AWS, so that’s what I’ll show you how to do. If you prefer other services, take a look at the instructions for other registries in the <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/configuration/docker-registry/">Kamal documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Log in to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">AWS Management Console</a> and go to Amazon ECR. Click on <code>Create repository</code> and set a name for your repository.</p>
<p>Then, create a new IAM user in your AWS account by going to Services &gt; IAM &gt; Users &gt; Add user.</p>
<p>Instead of using a predefined policy, create a new one with the following JSON and attach it to the user:</p>

<p>This policy allows the user to list, get, and manage the ECR repository you created earlier and get the authorization token to push and pull the image. You will need to replace the <code>&lt;REGION&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ACCOUNT_ID&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;REPOSITORY_NAME&gt;</code> with the values for your repository.</p>
<p>Next, select the user you created and go to Security credentials &gt; Access keys &gt; Create access key. Download the CSV file and keep it in a secure location.</p>
<p>You will use those credentials in your Github Actions pipeline to push and pull the image from the ECR registry.</p>

<section id="set-up-kamal-in-your-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="set-up-kamal-in-your-project">Set up Kamal in your project</h2>
<p>Open your Django project in your favorite code editor. Create a folder called <code>deploy</code> in the root directory. Then go into the folder and initialize Kamal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">kamal</span> init</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will create two folders (<code>.kamal/</code> and <code>config/</code>) and an <code>.env</code> file. Inside <code>config/</code>, you’ll find a <code>deploy.yml</code> file. This is where you’ll provide the instructions for Kamal to build and deploy your app.</p>
<p>You can use the following <code>deploy.yml</code> file as a template for your Django app:</p>

<p>This will set up your app and a reverse proxy using Traefik (with automatic SSL certificates using Let’s Encrypt), a Redis database, and a volume to persist the SQLite database. It will also do a healthcheck on <code>/up</code> on port <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>Remember to replace the placeholders with your own values.</p>
<section id="test-the-configuration-locally" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-the-configuration-locally">Test the configuration locally</h3>
<p>To test it locally, first, you’ll have to define the required environment variables in the <code>.env</code> file, such as the Django secret key, OpenAI API key, and any other secrets you need.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to get a temporary password for the ECR registry. You can get this password by running the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">aws</span> ecr get-login-password <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--region</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;</span>YOUR_REGION<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should copy the output of this command and paste it in the <code>KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD</code> field in the <code>.env</code> file.</p>
<p>Then, run the following command to deploy your application to your VPS:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">kamal</span> env push</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">kamal</span> deploy</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first command will push the environment variables to the VPS. The second command will build the Docker image, push it to the ECR registry, and deploy it to your VPS.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, your app should be live at <code>https://&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If you see any errors, there are two things you can do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Run <code>kamal app logs</code> to see the logs of the app.</li>
<li>Open a terminal in the container by running <code>kamal app exec -it bash</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how I usually debug the app.</p>

<p>This workflow will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Checkout the code</li>
<li>Set up the Ruby environment and install Kamal</li>
<li>Configure the AWS credentials</li>
<li>Login to the AWS ECR registry</li>
<li>Set up Docker Buildx for cache</li>
<li>Expose GitHub Runtime for cache</li>
<li>Create the <code>.env</code> file</li>
<li>Run Kamal deploy</li>
</ol>
<p>It will run everytime you make a push to the main branch or by manually triggering the workflow. It’ll cancel any in-progress runs to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>Also, before you push your code to the repository, you’ll need to add the following secrets to the repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY</code>: The private key to connect to your VPS</li>
<li><code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR</code>: The access key ID for the AWS ECR registry</li>
<li><code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR</code>: The secret access key for the AWS ECR registry</li>
<li><code>DJANGO_SECRET_KEY</code>: The Django secret key</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, to speed up the deployment, add these options to the <code>builder</code> section of the <code>deploy.yml</code> file:</p>

<p>This will enable the Docker Buildx cache for the build process in Github Actions. You can set <code>multiarch</code> to <code>false</code> if your CI pipeline shares the same architecture as your VPS, which was the case for me.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a fully automated deployment pipeline for your Django app. A push to the <code>main</code> branch will trigger the workflow, which will build the Docker image, push it to the ECR registry, and deploy it to your VPS.</p>
<p>Break free from the tyranny of manual deployments and expensive cloud services. Sleep like a baby and let Kamal handle your deployments.</p>

  <title>Classifying images with Gemini Flash 1.5</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Most people think of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00234">In-Context Learning (ICL)</a> — the ability of LLMs to learn from examples provided in the context — only as a component of RAG applications.</p>
<p>I used to think of it that way too. Until I recently found out that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with ICL can be used to perform more traditional ML tasks such as image classification.</p>
<p>I was skeptical at first, but was surprised to see that it worked pretty well both in the literature (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09798">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07407">here</a>) and in my own experiments.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t expect state-of-the-art results with it, but it can often give you pretty good results with very little effort and data.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to use ICL to classify images using Gemini Flash 1.5.</p>
<section id="why-gemini-flash-1.5" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-gemini-flash-1.5">Why Gemini Flash 1.5?</h2>
<p>You can use any MLLM for this task, but I chose Gemini Flash 1.5 because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s cheaper than <a href="https://ai.google.dev/pricing">Gemini Pro 1.5</a>, <a href="https://platform.openai.com/pricing">GPT-4o</a>, and <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/vision#calculate-image-costs">Sonnet 3.5</a>. For an image of <em>512x512</em> pixels, Gemini Flash 1.5 is 50x cheaper than Gemini Pro 1.5, 5x to 16x cheaper than GPT-4o, and 26x cheaper than Sonnet 3.5<sup>1</sup>.</li>
<li>It lets you use up to 3,000 images per request. By trial and error, I found that GPT-4o seems to have a hard limit at 250 images per request and Sonnet 3.5’s documentation mentions a limit of 20 images per request.</li>
<li>It works well. If you really want to squeeze the last bit of performance out of your model, you can use a bigger model, but for the purposes of this tutorial, Gemini Flash 1.5 will do just fine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of the model you choose, this tutorial will be a good starting point for you to classify images using ICL.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To follow this tutorial you’ll need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sign up and generate an API key in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey">Google AI Studio</a>.</li>
<li>Set the API key as an environment variable called <code>GEMINI_API_KEY</code>.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species?resource=download">this dataset</a> and save it to <code>data/</code>.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment and install the requirements:</li>

<p>In addition to the usual popular libraries (e.g.&nbsp;<code>pandas</code>, <code>sklearn</code>), you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>google.generativeai</code> for interacting with the Gemini API</li>
<li><code>PIL</code> for handling images</li>
<li><code>sklearn</code> for calculating performance metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, you’ll need to configure the Gemini API client with your API key:</p>

<p>To make a fair evaluation of the model’s performance, you should split the dataset into separate training and testing sets. The training set is used to provide context or examples to the model during inference. The testing set, comprised of unseen images, is then used to measure the model’s performance.</p>
<p>This process is different from the traditional “training” process, where you update the model’s weights or parameters. Here, you’re only providing the model with a set of images and asking it to learn from them at inference time.</p>
<p>This function will help you create the datasets:</p>

<p>This prompt explains the task to the model. You’re providing it with a set of labels with corresponding images, and a set of images that should be classified into one of those labels. The model needs to output a single label for each image.</p>
<p>I included an additional field called <code>number_of_labeled_images</code> because I noticed that the model would often “forget” to include all the labels in the output, and this was a simple way to ensure that it did so.</p>

</div>
<p>First, you’ll create a message with the context images and their corresponding labels. This is the “training” part of ICL.</p>
<p>In <code>create_context_images_message</code>, you’re iterating over the training dataset, grouping the images by class and appending the images and labels to the messages list.</p>
<p>The resulting message will look something like this:</p>
<div id="cell-31" class="cell" data-execution_count="9">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1">context_images_message[:<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;

 &lt;PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x224&gt;,
 'label: class_1']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>You might have noticed that instead of the actual names of the classes, you’re using <code>class_0</code>, <code>class_1</code>, etc. This is because I want to make the model prediction as “fair” as possible, see the baseline performance section for more details.</p>
<p>Then, you’ll create a message with the input images. This are the images for which the model will generate predictions.</p>
<p>Simlar to the context images message, you’re iterating over the test dataset and appending the images to the messages list.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-leakage-and-baseline-performance">Data leakage and baseline performance</h3>
<p>You might be thinking, “MLLMs have been trained on a lot of data, so they already know a lot of the images in the dataset, which means that these results are inflated”.</p>
<p>Which is a good point, and for that purpose I’ve done two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Anonymize the names of the classes (e.g., <code>class_0</code> instead of <code>Sleepy Orange</code>), so that the model doesn’t have any information about the actual labels.</li>
<li>Run a quick experiment using a zero-shot<sup>2</sup> model without anonymizing the labels to see the model’s performance.</li>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s all!</p>
<p>I still find it amazing that without any “real” training and just a few minutes of work, you can achieve pretty good results in a non-trivial image classification task using ICL with Gemini Flash 1.5 (or most other MLLMs).</p>
<p>This is a mostly unexplored area. There’s a lot of room for trying out different ideas and seeing what works best. This tutorial is just a starting point.</p>
<p>Hope you found it useful! Let me know if you have any questions in the comments below.</p>

  <title>Fixing missing ‘python’ error in macOS</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/til/fixing-python-not-found-error-in-macos.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After the last macOS update, I started getting the following error when trying to run <code>poetry install</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource shell number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode"><span id="cb1-1">[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'python'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I went through GitHub issues, StackOverflow questions, and blog posts, but none of the suggested solutions worked.</p>
<p>Finally, I found the solution somewhat hidden in this <a href="https://mac.install.guide/python/brew">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>So, what’s the fix?</p>
<p>🥁 🥁 🥁</p>
<p>Just add the following line to your <code>.zshrc</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">export</span> <span class="va" style="color: #111111;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">PATH</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"</span><span class="va" style="color: #111111;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$(</span><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">brew</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--prefix</span> python<span class="va" style="color: #111111;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">)</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">/libexec/bin:</span><span class="va" style="color: #111111;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$PATH</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This gets the installation prefix for <code>python</code> installed via Homebrew (e.g.&nbsp;<code>/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12</code>), gets the <code>libexec/bin</code> directory, and adds it to the PATH.</p>
<p>In that <code>libexec/bin</code>, there’s a <code>python</code> executable that gets called when you run <code>python</code> in the terminal.</p>
<p>That’s all. Hope that helps!</p>

  <title>Create a Kamal-ready VPS on Hetzner using Terraform</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/posts/create-a-kamal-ready-vps-on-hetzner-using-terraform.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>These days, I deploy all my side projects using Kamal and GitHub Actions on Hetzner. Once you get the hang of it, it’s easy to maintain, fast, and cheap.</p>
<p>You can run your app with a database (SQLite), caching (Redis), background jobs (Celery), and SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt) for roughly €5/month. Plus, if you feel the need, you can easily scale up to a more powerful Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>
<p>But setting up a VPS with the right configuration takes a bit of time. You have to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Manually create the VPS using the UI.</li>
<li>Create the necessary SSH keys.</li>
<li>Create and apply the firewall rules.</li>
<li>Create a new non-root user.</li>
<li>Install Docker and other necessary software.</li>
<li>Configure unattended-upgrades.</li>
<li>Create a directory and set permissions for Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates.</li>
<li>Reboot the system to apply all changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I already had a small script to do most of these steps, but I wanted to automate it to a single command. So I created a Terraform script to do it for me.</p>
<p>I took <a href="https://github.com/luizkowalski/terraform-hetzner">terraform-hetzner</a> and modified it to work with a single VPS instance. My updated version is available <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/terraform-kamal-single-vps">here</a>.</p>
<section id="set-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="set-up">Set up</h2>
<p>First, set up an <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/">API key</a> with <strong>read and write</strong> permissions in Hetzner Cloud.</p>
<p>Second, install <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli">terraform</a>.</p>
<p>Third, clone the repo:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">git</span> clone https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/terraform-kamal-single-vps</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Fourth, create a <code>terraform.tfvars</code> file with the following variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource hcl number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode"><span id="cb2-1">hetzner_api_key = "your-api-key"</span>
<span id="cb2-2">ssh_vps_root_key = "&lt;your-ssh-root-public-key&gt;"</span>
<span id="cb2-3">ssh_vps_kamal_key = "&lt;your-ssh-kamal-public-key&gt;"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>ssh_vps_root_key</code> and <code>ssh_vps_kamal_key</code> are the public keys for the root and kamal users, respectively. You can generate them with the <code>make generate-ssh-key USER_NAME=root</code> or <code>make generate-ssh-key USER_NAME=kamal</code> commands I added to the repo.</p>
<p>Store your SSH keys in a secure location. You’ll need them to access the VPS.</p>
</section>
<section id="run-the-script" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-the-script">Run the script</h2>
<p>Once the <code>terraform.tfvars</code> file is set up, you can see what changes will be applied with the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">terraform</span> plan</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will show in detail what changes will be applied to create a Kamal-ready VPS. If you’re happy with it, you can apply the changes with the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">terraform</span> apply</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will create a VPS with the following configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</li>
<li>2 VCPU</li>
<li>2 GB RAM</li>
<li>40 GB SSD</li>
</ul>
<p>It’ll cost you roughly €5/month and will be located in Nuremberg (Germany).</p>
<p>In addition, after the VPS is created, it will automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a non-root user (kamal) with sudo privileges.</li>
<li>Install the required software (Git, Docker, curl, etc.)</li>
<li>Create a directory for Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates.</li>
<li>Create a firewall rule to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic.</li>
<li>Create a directory for the database (SQLite) and the cache (Redis) (<code>db/</code> and <code>data/</code>)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="customizing-the-script" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customizing-the-script">Customizing the script</h2>
<p>You can customize the script to fit your needs. Here are a couple of things you can change:</p>
<section id="change-the-software-to-install" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="change-the-software-to-install">Change the software to install</h3>
<p>If you want to change the software to install, you can modify the <code>packages</code> section in <code>cloudinit/vps.yml</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="run-other-commands-after-the-vps-is-created" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-other-commands-after-the-vps-is-created">Run other commands after the VPS is created</h3>
<p>If you want to run other commands after the VPS is created, you can add them to the <code>runcmd</code> section in the <code>cloudinit/vps.yml</code> file.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-already-existing-firewall-rules" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-already-existing-firewall-rules">Use already existing firewall rules</h3>
<p>If you want to use already existing firewall rules, you can modify how the firewalls are attached in <code>cloud.tf</code>. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/terraform-kamal-single-vps/blob/4a1a6edafc1c9e927f20906298ccd083718bc97e/cloud.tf#L72C1-L91C4">this section</a> of <code>cloud.tf</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-a-different-server-type-operating-system-or-region" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-a-different-server-type-operating-system-or-region">Use a different server type, operating system, or region</h3>
<p>If you want to use a different server type, operating system, or region, you can modify the <code>server_type</code>, <code>region</code>, <code>operating_system</code> variables in <code>variables.tf</code>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This script is a great way to create a Kamal-ready VPS on Hetzner using Terraform. It’s easy to maintain, fast, and cheap.</p>
<p>All the code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/terraform-kamal-single-vps">repo</a>.</p>
<p>Hope you find this useful!</p>

<p><a href="https://levels.io/">Pieter Levels</a> makes over $100k/month with a single VPS using PHP and jQuery. And until very recently, his deployment process was simply <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28838537">uploading files via FTP</a>.</p>
<p>If you focus on what your users want and know how to market your product, you can make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Which is why I decided to stay poor and spent an inordinate amount of time improving my deployment process.</p>
<p>Who needs money when you can get the satisfaction of that beautiful green check mark after you’ve run your CI/CD pipeline?</p>
<p>Anyways…</p>
<p>These days, I’m using <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">kamal</a> to deploy most of my projects.</p>
<p>I used to hate Docker. But, like with Gollum, I’ve come to realize that it’s not that bad after all.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a simple Dockerfile to run a Django app using Poetry, with a SQLite database, and hot reload. Additionally, I wanted to switch between the development and production versions of the container.</p>
<p>So here’s a simple Dockerfile that does just that.</p>
<section id="project-structure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
<p>This is my project structure:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;

<span id="cb1-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

<span id="cb1-4"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

<span id="cb1-5"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

<span id="cb1-8"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">└──</span> pyproject.toml</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>src/</code> directory contains the Django project. The <code>db/</code> directory contains the SQLite database. The <code>entrypoint.sh</code> file is the entrypoint for the Docker container.</p>
<p>If your project is not structured in a similar way, you might need to adapt the files below to your needs.</p>
</section>
<section id="dockerfile" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h2>
<p>I created a <code>Dockerfile</code> that fulfilled this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A base stage with Python 3.10 and Poetry installed.</li>
<li>A builder stage that installs the dependencies.</li>
<li>A runner stage that copies the virtual environment from the builder stage.</li>
<li>A development stage that runs the entrypoint as a root user.</li>
<li>A production stage that runs the entrypoint as a non-root user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the full <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<p>I also use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/file-watch/">Compose Watch</a> to reload the container when I make changes to the code and to rebuild the container when I make changes to the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p>

  <title>Migrate a blog from Ghost to Quarto</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/til/migrate-blog-from-ghost-to-quarto.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>When I started blogging five years ago, I read all reddit posts comparing blogging platforms and concluded that <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> was the best choice because I needed a powerful tool for all those millions of visitors my blog would get.</p>
<p>I saw myself as the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez">García Márquez</a> of technical writing.</p>
<p>Fast forward five years, and I’ve paid $2,000 for hosting a blog that barely gets 8k visits per month. Plus, I’m forced to write it in an interface that I hate.</p>
<p>With that kind of money, I could have funded a moderately extravagant hamster-only summer party.</p>
<p>Not that I should, but I could.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m not proud of that decision<sup>1</sup>. So I’m migrating my blog from Ghost to Quarto.</p>
<p>Here’s a short guide on how to migrate your blog from Ghost to Quarto.</p>
<section id="migrate-blog-from-ghost-to-quarto" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="migrate-blog-from-ghost-to-quarto">Migrate blog from Ghost to Quarto</h2>
<section id="setting-up-your-blog" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-your-blog">Setting up your blog</h3>
<p>First, install <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> and create a blog in an empty repository:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">quarto</span> create project blog myblog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The resulting <code>myblog</code> folder will contain the barebones configuration for a Quarto blog and a <code>posts</code> folder with some example posts. You can remove those posts. Later on, you’ll add your own.</p>
</section>
<section id="exporting-your-ghosts-blog-content" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exporting-your-ghosts-blog-content">Exporting your Ghost’s blog content</h3>
<p>Then, you need to download a copy of your Ghost’s blog content.</p>
<p>Go to <code>&lt;YOUR_BLOG_URL&gt;/ghost/#/settings/migration</code> and click on <code>Export</code>, then <code>Export JSON</code>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><a href="images/ghost-export.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Exporting my blog"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/til/images/ghost-export.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Exporting my blog"></a></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Exporting my blog</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is pretty obvious, but remember to replace <code>&lt;YOUR_BLOG_URL&gt;</code> with your blog’s URL.</p>
<p>You’ll get a JSON file with all the posts and pages in your blog. You’ll need to process it to convert your posts to Quarto posts.</p>
<p>This small Python script did the heavy lifting for me:</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/blog/blob/main/_quarto.yml">settings</a> for an example and a recent post <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/blog/blob/main/posts/create-a-kamal-ready-vps-on-hetzner-using-terraform.qmd">source</a> for reference.</p>
<p>For the CSS, I copied <a href="https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/themes/darkly.scss">darkly</a> and created a custom <code>custom.scss</code> file to modify some Bootstrap styles. I just changed some colors and a couple of styles to make the blog look closer to my Ghost theme. It was super easy.</p>
</section>
<section id="deployment-using-github-pages-github-actions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deployment-using-github-pages-github-actions">Deployment using GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions</h3>
<p>Quarto offers multiple <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/">deployment options</a>. I wanted one where I could push changes to a GitHub repository, and have the blog automatically deployed. I went with GitHub Pages combined with GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>To deploy the blog, I created a <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/blog">GitHub repository</a>, added the blog’s content, updated <code>.gitignore</code> to ignore the <code>/.quarto/</code> and <code>/_site/</code> and updated <code>_quarto.yml</code> to only compute code locally (otherwise you’d need a Python kernel running on your GitHub Actions runner):</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>_quarto.yml</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" data-filename="_quarto.yml" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource yml number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">execute</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">  </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">freeze</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"> auto</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then I ran this command to automatically generate the workflow <code>.github/workflows/publish.yml</code> for me:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">quarto</span> publish gh-pages</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since then, every time I push changes to the <code>main</code> branch, GitHub Actions automatically renders the website and updates the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-a-custom-domain" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-a-custom-domain">Using a custom domain</h3>
<p>That seemed to work at first, but very quickly I noticed that whenever I pushed changes to the <code>main</code> branch, the site would no longer be served from my custom domain <a href="https://dylancastillo.co">dylancastillo.co</a>.</p>
<p>When you render your website, Quarto recreates the CNAME file in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, which seems to break the custom domain setup in GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>I found a solution in this <a href="https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/5341">discussion</a> and added a CNAME file to the root of the repository with my custom domain:</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>CNAME</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" data-filename="CNAME" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource txt number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb8-1">dylancastillo.co</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then, I added this to <code>_quarto.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>_quarto.yml</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" data-filename="_quarto.yml" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource yml number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<p>Ever since I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wU8k2kDaTo">The Matrix</a>, I’ve wanted to be a hacker.</p>
<p>When I say hacker, I mean having a cool-looking terminal. The kind that makes people think I’m a stealing millions from banks when, in reality, I’m just struggling to exit vim.</p>
<p>I use macOS. The closest I’ve been to being a hacker is using <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim">vim hotkeys</a> in VSCode.</p>
<p>It’s not that I haven’t tried to look the part. I was a just one audio driver away from saying <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/9xgfxq/why_i_use_arch_btw/">“I use Arch btw”</a>. I did succeed with Ubuntu, but honestly, using Linux as my main OS always felt like too much work<sup>1</sup>. So that didn’t last long.</p>
<p>But, today, after reading about <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/introducing-omakub-354db366">DHH’s Omakub</a>, I though it was time to give my hacker dreams a second shot.</p>
<p>Installing Ubuntu felt like a bit too much work<sup>2</sup>, so I decided to settle on just upgrading my terminal.</p>
<p>I decided to set up Alacritty, Zellij, and Neovim on my M3 MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Sure, I have client projects to deliver. But how could I let go of one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to procrastinate and imagine I’m a genius hacker for an afternoon?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-alacritty">Installing Alacritty</h2>
<p>Alacritty is a terminal emulator, similar to <a href="https://iterm2.com/">Iterm2</a> and others. It’s selling point is that it’s very fast due to GPU-acceleration. Plus, you also get 256 colors support by default.</p>
<p>The best way to install it is using Homebrew:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">brew</span> install <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--cask</span> alacritty</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, you you can customize it to your liking by creating a <code>~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml</code> file.</p>
<p>I ended up modifying just a couple of things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Increase padding.</li>
<li>Change the font.</li>
<li>Change the color scheme. I used One Dark from <a href="https://gist.github.com/r-darwish/f8bb21a6c89a02c4bef76cc38bddad39">this gist</a>.</li>

<p>Zellij is an improved version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux"><code>tmux</code></a>. Whenever I used tmux, I spent half my time figuring out the key bindings. Zellij shows the key bindings on screen (unless you disable it), which greatly improves the user experience.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-neovim-and-lazyvim">Installing Neovim and LazyVim</h2>
<p><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> is a fork from <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, that solves some of Vim’s issues<sup>3</sup>. I didn’t really know if it was better or worse than Vim, but given that DHH recommended it, I thought it was a good idea to give it a shot.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LazyVim/starter">LazyVim</a> is a premade configuration for Neovim. The purists will probably hate it, but it’s a good start.</p>
<p>I had my own <code>.vimrc</code>, and after trying LazyVim for 30 minutes or so, I realized my config sucked.</p>
<p>First, install Neovim using Homebrew.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;

<p>Then, install LazyVim.</p>

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">git</span> clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So far, I’ve only made a few changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed <a href="https://github.com/github/copilot.vim">Copilot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim">CopilotChat</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.surround">mini-surround</a>.</li>
<li>Installed <a href="https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim">One Dark</a> color scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugins I mentioned are available in <code>:LazyExtras</code>, so it’s very easy to install them. Run <code>:LazyExtras</code>, select the plugins, and then install them with <span class="visually-hidden">I</span>.</p>
<p>To install <code>One Dark</code>, you must create a new file in <code>~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/</code> containing the following code:</p>

<p>I also added a couple of aliases from Omakub:</p>

  <title>Live Components with Django and htmx</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I discovered <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/django-components/"><code>django-components</code></a> late last year and I quickly realized it was the missing piece in my Django + htmx workflow. It made my developer experience so much better, that I even started contributing to it.</p>
<p><code>django-components</code> lets you build components that combine HTML, JS, and CSS in a single place. Plus, it now lets you use components as views. This feature allows you to keep all the logic for a part of your application in one place, giving you great <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">locality of behavior</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/click-to-load/">click-to-load</a> component would look something like this:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="django-live-components">Django Live Components</h2>
<p>I thought it’d be fun to use the library for something it wasn’t designed for: streaming component changes through server-sent events (SSE).</p>
<p>It took me a few hours and several reads of <a href="https://valberg.dk/">Víðir’s tutorial</a> to figure it out, but it worked. It’s a bit hacky but all the pieces were there. I just had to find a way to put them together.</p>
<p>The code is available <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/django-live-components">here</a>.</p>
<p>I had a simple idea: set up a <a href="https://redis.io/docs/interact/pubsub/">Redis</a> <a href="https://redis.io/docs/interact/pubsub/">pub/sub channel</a> for server notifications. When the client loads the page, it subscribes to this notification channel. Each time the server publishes a new notification, the system reads it from the channel. Then, it renders the HTML and sends it to the client using Server-Sent Events (SSE).</p>
<p>First, you need a notification component, with a streaming view that updates the client whenever a new notification occurs, and a way to subscribe to new notifications sent from the server.</p>
<p>Here’s what I came up with:</p>

<p>You can run Redis on Docker to run this script. It’ll start adding notifications to the Redis channel, that you’ll see flash on the page.</p>
<p>This was fun. I ended up using a similar pattern in <a href="https://aitheneum.iwanalabs.com/">AItheneum</a>.</p>

  <title>2023: Personal Snapshot</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is my annual review. It serves two purposes: a deep analysis of the past year and a record of my thoughts at the time of writing.</p>
<p>I hope it’s fun to read or, at the very least, provides some interesting insights.</p>
<p>If it’s me rereading this, welcome back. This is Dylan from 2023.</p>
<section id="what-went-well" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-went-well">What went well?</h2>
<p>According to my <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/">GitHub account</a>, I committed code 276 out of 365 days in 2023. I likely coded even more since there were days when I didn’t commit my code. Also, sometimes I used a different account for projects due to company policy.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">Squint to see the secret message</figcaption>

</div>
<p>The more I code the more I learn. So, as long as I stay honest and avoid committing useless code, coding serves as a good proxy of how much I’ve learned about technical topics throughout the year. This year, I felt I learned a lot, so I’m happy.</p>
<p>Despite reaching an all-time high compared to previous years, I think I could have achieved more. Sometimes, especially between projects or during periods when I felt burned out, I procrastinated quite a bit. Next year, I want to improve this.</p>
<p>I shipped five AI apps (not including client work). I developed four on my own and created one with a friend. Two of them made it to the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34547015">Hacker</a> News and got featured in <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/28/investors-are-going-nuts-for-chatgpt-ish-artificial-intelligence">The Economist</a>. Another one won brownie points in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sz-Nmi_5xg&amp;t=1432s">AI Shark Tank</a>.</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">AI apps I built in 2023</figcaption>

</div>
<p>I also wrote 9 blog posts. I was very motivated at first and worked with a good friend, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hujingjing/">Jing</a>, as an accountability partner. We ended up prioritizing other projects and stopped the accountability challenge, but it was fun and effective while it lasted. I’m very grateful to Jing for joining me in this challenge.</p>
<p>I focused on writing tutorials about AI topics, but I got tired after a while. Writing high-quality tutorials demands a lot of effort. Plus, AI evolves so fast that my tutorials often become outdated within months. That sucked!</p>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">My stats looking like 💩</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When I stopped writing regularly, my site’s traffic started to drop. I also believe ChatGPT was a major factor. My basic-level tutorials, which ChatGPT can easily replace, have stopped growing.</p>
<p>I’m making a change this year in my content creation strategy. I’ll focus on creating videos for technical topics and write about <em>evergreen</em> subjects on my blog. I’ve realized that making videos for technical content is a time-saver compared to writing tutorials. Showing users directly through videos is simpler than writing detailed descriptions or taking screenshots and explaining them.</p>
<p>My original plan for my blog was to share my thoughts. I ended up writing technical tutorials because it was a more effective way to drive traffic, but in all honesty, I didn’t enjoy it very much. So I’m going back to my original plan.</p>
<p>I posted more or less consistently on LinkedIn throughout the year. I got roughly 420k views on my posts. A third of those views came from a single <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dylanjcastillo_a-hackers-guide-to-language-models-activity-7117426046404063233-_T51?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a>, and I gained ~2.3k followers.</p>

<p>I met lots of great people and had tons of catch-ups this year. I am grateful for all the people I met this year. Special thanks go to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-maximilian-brunner/">Max</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanuel-schamp/">Emanuel</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jscastanoc/">Sebastián</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-gonzalo-almorox-phd-5b8b4955">Edu</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhys-donoghue/">Rhys</a> for the collaborations we did. Not all things went as planned, but we had fun.</p>
<p>Posting random things online helps me chat, befriend, learn from, and even do business with people I wouldn’t have met otherwise. It feels great!</p>
<p>I did more sales this year. I took part in two 6-figure proposals that didn’t pan out, and landed two 5-figure contracts, each setting a new record for my hourly rate. I also sold quite a few small projects. Selling is fun but I’m not great at it. This is one of the focuses for next year.</p>
<p>Financially, things went well. Despite being more focused on learning than on making money this year, I made ~2.5x my annual burn rate (I’m frugal!). All my income was made through freelancing, and 68% of my income came from a single project. This situation is better than the past two years because I’m a bit less dependent on one client. But I’m still not where I want to be. To lower my risk, I want to spread my income more evenly across different clients.</p>
<p>Healthwise, this year went well. I completed 169 strength training sessions, averaging 3 gym visits per week. I’m pretty happy with that. I faced some minor injuries but dealt with them effectively.</p>
<p>Also, I completed 4,711 minutes of <a href="https://www.howardluksmd.com/zone-2-hr-training-live-longer-less-injury/">Z2 training</a> (roughly 90 minutes per week). For Z2, I experimented with running, cycling, and stair-climbing. Running is my favorite, but stair-climbing lets me multitask. So, I mostly split my time between these two activities.</p>
<p>This year, I gave stand-up comedy a shot, all thanks to my wife. I’ve wanted to try it for a long time but kept coming up with excuses. For our fifth anniversary, she surprised me by signing me up for a <a href="https://estudioteatromadrid.com/cursos/intensivo-curso-de-stand-up-iniciacion/">course</a>. It’s my favorite gift since getting a Game Boy Advance twenty years ago.</p>

<p>For those who know me in real life, you’ll know that I don’t enjoy speaking in public. So this was a real challenge for me. I did a presentation with family and friends and went to four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mic">open mics</a>.</p>
<p>IT WAS GREAT! Even though I felt terrified before stepping onto the stage, I ended up having a lot of fun. Most of my jokes made people laugh, which felt comforting.</p>
<p>I do need to work on my stage presence. I often stood in awkward places, struggled to make eye contact with the audience during punchlines, and frequently said “Ehhh… Uhhh…”</p>
<p>I’ve opened an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dylanporque/">IG account</a> for my comedy stuff. I haven’t posted anything yet, but I’m planning to start in the next few weeks. For now, I will post in Spanish. Follow me there if you want to stay updated!</p>
<p>Finally, this year has been good for my relationships with my wife, family, and friends. My wife and I continue to work as a team, each of us progressing in our respective areas and supporting one another. And I made time to enjoy with family and friends.</p>
<p>In my last snapshot, I didn’t include any photos. When I revised it a few days ago, I realized I missed having them. So, this time, I’ve included a few.</p>

<p>This year, a family highlight was my in-laws’ visit to Madrid for a few months. We found out that our family loves karaoke, especially my dad and my father-in-law. It was tough to get them off the microphone!</p>
<p>More importantly, my loved ones remain healthy and happy, and so am I.</p>

<section id="what-didnt-go-well" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-didnt-go-well">What didn’t go well?</h2>
<p>I didn’t write a 2022 personal snapshot. That wasn’t a great way to start 2023.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/my-entrepreneur-first-experience/">Entrepreneur First</a>, I felt burned out and lacked the motivation to write a detailed review of the past year. I kept putting it off until it was way too late. And nobody wants to read your annual review in August!</p>
<p>I failed to get funding twice this year. First from <a href="https://www.joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>, and second, from <a href="https://www.speedinvest.com/">Speedinvest</a>. Pitching, preparing the materials, and all the discussions involved were a cool experience, but the outcome was frustrating both times.</p>
<p>I’m not sure it would have worked out. In both cases, I wasn’t too excited about the idea, but I thought it was worth a try. My main concern with raising venture capital money too early often leads to poor financial outcomes for founders. That’s a no-no for me.</p>
<p>Though, bootstrapping isn’t easy either. My most successful AI product made 60€. Just enough for a decent dinner for two in Madrid.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><a href="images/2023-personal-snapshot/image-5-1-1.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-15" title="My “best” AI product"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/2023-personal-snapshot/image-5-1-1.png" height="300" alt="My “best” AI product" class="figure-img"></a></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">My “best” AI product</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The AI apps I built this year landed me several freelancing projects. But they made little money by themselves. To be fair, I only launched two products you could pay for. I didn’t intend the others to make money, at least not initially.</p>
<p>This year, I finally grasped something you might find obvious: to have products that generate revenue, you must be intentional about it. You must create opportunities for people to pay.</p>
<p>I used to believe that if I built something cool enough, people would discover it and somehow find a way to pay for it. I was wrong. I realized that I must actively set up a payment system for my products or deliberately plan how to monetize the attention they receive. Without that, after the initial burst of attention fades, you might end up with nothing. Many of my projects this year suffered this fate.</p>
<p>I’ve always dreamed of creating a product, so I ignored the market’s pull towards a consulting company. Instead of doubling down on the demand, I often said no, aiming to focus on my product ideas. After spending much of this year like a person with a hammer in search of a nail, I’ve decided to reverse my approach.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><a href="images/2023-personal-snapshot/image-6.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-16" title="Me running away from the demand"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/2023-personal-snapshot/image-6.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Me running away from the demand"></a></p>
<figcaption class="margin-caption">Me running away from the demand</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Now, I’ll start with the demand and then figure out how to offer services to meet it. My focus will be on establishing a consulting practice. From there, I might develop a product. But then again, maybe I don’t need to. I’m content with the idea of getting rich through a services-only company 😉</p>
<p>Although I’m satisfied with my physical fitness, I’ve noticed that I often don’t rest enough. This happens either because I don’t sleep enough or because I overtrain. I’ve started feeling some symptoms of this, so improving my rest is a goal for next year.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-plans-for-next-year" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-plans-for-next-year">What are the plans for next year?</h2>
<p>First, focus on building a successful consulting practice. I’ll be doing a lot more sales this year and plan to share updates frequently. I have some exciting news about this that I’ll be sharing soon.</p>
<p>Next, establishing a sustainable content engine. I believe shifting to video for technical content might yield a higher ROI than text. So, this year, I plan to explore this approach and reserve the blog for more personal articles.</p>
<p>Keep doing stand-up comedy. I haven’t found such an enjoyable hobby in a long time. I want to do more of it. It also brings extra benefits, like improving my sales skills.</p>
<p>Finally, make time for rest. I often struggle with guilt over taking breaks, leading to very few days off throughout the year. But this isn’t good for my mental and physical well-being. I aim to create more space for rest, and I’m sure my wife and family will appreciate that too 😁</p>

  <title>Clustering Documents with OpenAI embeddings, HDBSCAN and UMAP</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/posts/clustering-documents-with-openai-langchain-hdbscan.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In the past, the most common way to cluster documents was by building vectors with traditional Machine Learning methods such as bag-of-words or smaller pre-trained NLP models, like BERT, and then creating groups out of them. But LLMs have changed that.</p>
<p>While older methods are still relevant, if I had to cluster text data today, I’d start using the OpenAI or Cohere (embeddings and generation) APIs. It’s faster, easier, and gives you additional goodies such as coming up with fitting titles for each cluster.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen many tutorials on this topic, so I wrote one. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to cluster news articles using OpenAI embeddings, and HDBSCAN.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it!</p>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To make the most of this tutorial, you should be familiar with the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dylancastillo.co/nlp-snippets-cluster-documents-using-word2vec/#how-to-cluster-documents">How to cluster text data</a> using traditional ML methods.</li>
<li>What are <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">OpenAI Embeddings</a></li>
<li>How <a href="https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html">HDBSCAN</a> works</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you’ll need an <a href="beta.openai.com/">OpenAI account</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering-documents">Clustering Documents</h2>
<p>You should think of the clustering process in three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate numerical vector representations of documents using OpenAI’s embedding capabilities.</li>
<li>Apply a clustering algorithm on the vectors to group the documents.</li>
<li>Generate a title for each cluster summarizing the articles contained in it.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! Now, you’ll see how that looks in practice.</p>
<section id="import-the-required-packages" class="level3">

<p>This code imports the libraries you’ll use throughout the tutorial. Here’s the purpose of each one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>os</code></strong> helps you read the environment variables.</li>
<li><strong><code>hdbscan</code></strong> gives you a wrapper of HDBSCAN, the clustering algorithm you’ll use to group the documents.</li>
<li><strong><code>openai</code></strong> to use OpenAI LLMs.</li>
<li><strong><code>umap</code></strong> loads <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">UMAP</a> for dimensionality reduction and visualizing clusters.</li>
<li><strong><code>dotenv</code></strong> load the environment variables you define in <code>.env</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you’ll get a sample of news articles to cluster.</p>

<p>This code will generate clusters using the embeddings generated, and then create a DataFrame with the results. Itfits the <code>hdbscan</code> algorithm. In this case, I set <code>min_samples</code> and <code>min_cluster_size</code> to 3, but depending on your data this may change. Check <a href="https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter_selection.html">HDBSCAN’s documentation</a> to learn more about these parameters.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll create topic titles for each cluster based on their contents.</p>

<p>OpenAI has been giving access to users to the <a href="https://wgmimedia.com/chatgpt-code-interpreter-plugin/">Code Interpreter</a> plugin and people are loving it. I wanted to replicate it outside of ChatGPT, so I created my own (simpler) version, specifically to <a href="https://deepsheet.dylancastillo.co/">analyze and visualize data</a>.</p>
<p>Following that, I figured more people might be interested in building user-facing chatbots capable of running code in the browser. So I put together this tutorial. It will teach you how to create a simple but powerful chatbot that uses Pyodide, LangChain, and OpenAI to generate and run code in the browser for a user.</p>
<p>C’mon, let’s get to work!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To make the most of the tutorial, you should review these topics before getting started:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a> is.</li>
<li>What <a href="https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html">LangChain</a> is.</li>
<li>The basics of Python backend servers such as <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/2/">Litestar</a> or <a href="fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, you must create an account at <a href="https://beta.openai.com">OpenAI</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-a-code-interpreter-chatbot">Building a Code Interpreter Chatbot</h2>
<p>Security and scalability are two major challenges in developing a user-facing chatbot that’s capable of executing code. Companies like <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> must manage <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/repl-it">extremely complex infrastructures</a> in order to provide users with online IDEs.</p>
<p>We’re fortunate, however, because what we’re doing in this tutorial isn’t as complex as Replit. We can use a simple solution: Pyodide. Pyodide is a CPython port to WebAssembly/Emscripten that lets Python to run in the browser.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions to what you can do with Pyodide, such as the fact that <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html">not every package is compatible</a> with it and that the maximum memory it can manage is 2GB. But it is more than adequate to process small to medium datasets, which is what you’ll do in this tutorial.</p>
<p>The chatbot you’ll build will work as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A user asks a question about a preloaded dataset.</li>
<li>That question, along with a predefined prompt, is sent to the OpenAI API.</li>
<li>The API responds with a code snippet that helps answer the question.</li>
<li>The code snippet is executed on the browser using Pyodide, and the result is displayed to the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, you’ll set up your local environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="set-up-your-local-environment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="set-up-your-local-environment">Set Up Your Local Environment</h2>
<p>Before you begin, you must first set up a few things. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.10</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation">Poetry</a>. It’s optional but highly recommended.</li>
<li>Clone the project’s repository:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">git</span> clone https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/chatbot-code-interpreter</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>From the root folder of the project, install the dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>Poetry:</strong> Create the virtual environment in the same directory as the project and install the dependencies:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">poetry</span> config virtualenvs.in-project true</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">poetry</span> install</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>venv and pip:</strong> Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in <code>requirements.txt</code>:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">python3.10</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">-m</span> venv .venv <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">source</span> .venv/bin/activate</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">pip</span> install <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">-r</span> requirements.txt</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Open <code>src/.env-example</code>, add your OpenAI secret key in the corresponding variable, and save the file as <code>.env</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have a virtual environment set up with the necessary libraries and a local copy of the repository. Your project structure should look like this:</p>

<p>These are the most relevant files and directories in the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>poetry.lock</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code>: These files contain the project’s specifications and dependencies. They’re used by Poetry to create a virtual environment.</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code>: This file contains a list of Python packages required by the project.</li>
<li><code>src/app.py</code>: This file contains the code of the chatbot.</li>
<li><code>src/config.py</code>: This file contains project configuration details such as OpenAI’s API key (read from a <code>.env</code> file), and the path to the prompts used by the chatbot.</li>
<li><code>src/prompts/</code>: This directory contains the system and user prompts used by the chatbot. I’ve found that keeping the prompts in text files makes it easier to manage them instead of using strings.</li>
<li><code>src/static</code> and <code>src/templates</code>: These files contain the data used in the example and the HTML template used for the chatbot’s interface. You’ll use a dataset with prices and the volume of a group of stocks.</li>
<li><code>src/utils.py</code>: This file contains a function you use to read the prompts from <code>src/prompts</code>.</li>
<li><code>.env-example</code>: This file is a sample file that provides the required environment variables you should provide. In this case, you use it to pass OpenAI’s API key to your application and choose the name the chatbot should use behind the scenes (<code>gpt-3.5.-turbo</code>).</li>
<li><code>.venv/</code>: This directory contains the project’s virtual environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright! On to the exciting stuff now.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-code-on-the-browser-with-pyodide">Run Code on the Browser with Pyodide</h2>
<p>In this step, you’ll configure Pyodide to run Python in the browser. You’ll load <code>pyodide.js</code>, start it, import the required libraries, and define an event handler to process the questions asked by the user.</p>
<p>To make the analysis simpler, I’ll split the code of <code>src/templates/index.html</code> into two sections. In the first section, you’ll only look at the contents of <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, and in the second part, you’ll go through the JavaScript code defined in <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s part one:</p>

<p>This section of code loads the necessary libraries and styles, as well as defines the chatbot’s user interface. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 5 to 10</strong> set a title for the page, load <code>pyodide.js</code> and <code>pico.css</code> (a minimal CSS framework), and define a couple of standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta">meta tags</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 14 to 20</strong> define a simple UI that lets users input a question, and submit them by clicking on a button, to get answers about the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, let’s go through the JavaScript code defined in <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>. This code will load Pyodide, install the required libraries, make the data available for use in Pyodide, and set an event handler to process the user’s question.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks:</p>

<p>This code loads Pyodide, installs the necessary libraries, makes the data accessible in Pyodide, and finally sets an event handler to process the user’s question. It works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 3</strong> select the elements of the DOM that you’ll be interacting with.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 5 to 18</strong> define a helper function you use to load Pyodide and the data. You first load Pyodide, and install <code>pandas</code> and <code>numpy</code>. Then, you fetch the dataset and write it into Pyodide’s filesystem, to make it available to use the data in it.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 20 to 52</strong> define the event handler of a click on <code>ask-btn</code>. This means that whenever that button is clicked, this event will execute. The handler does a few things:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 21 to 33</strong> wait until Pyodide is fully loaded, extract the question that the user has asked, get the first rows of the dataset (which is how the model can know how to generate the right code), and put together the data to send in a POST request.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 35 to 51</strong> make a POST request to “/ask” with the parameters mentioned earlier. When the server responds, that text is run using Pyodide, and the result is then saved in <code>output</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! Next, you’ll create the chatbot application.</p>

<p>This code provides users with a straightforward interface, allowing them to interact with the chatbot and ask questions about the dataset. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 16</strong> import the required libraries. The application uses <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/2/">Litestar</a>, which is a bit verbose; hence, you’ll notice many import statements. But there’s no real mystery to it, it’s <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/2/migration/index.html">pretty similar to FastAPI or Flask</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 18 to 25</strong> create an <a href="https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/llm_chain.html">LLMChain</a> to interact with the model using the prompt read from <code>get_prompt</code>, which is a function defined in <code>utils.py</code> reads the prompts defined in <code>src/prompts</code>. The chain takes the prompts, the user’s query, and the first three rows from the dataset, and asks the model for a completion. Make sure to read the prompt to see how they work.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 28 to 30</strong> define the index route, which returns the <code>index.html</code> when a user visits <code>/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 33 to 54</strong> define a dataclass used to validate the parameters of the request made to <code>/ask</code> and define <code>/ask</code>, which is an endpoint that helps users answer questions about the dataset by generating relevant code.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 57 to 65</strong> set up the Litestar app, incorporating the previously defined routes and the locations of the templates and static files.</li>
</ul>
<p>To test the app, <code>cd</code> into <code>src/</code> and run this code in a terminal within the virtual environment:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">litestar</span> run <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--reload</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If everything goes well, you’ll see an output similar to this one:</p>
<p><a href="images/code-interpreter-chatbot-pyodide-langchain-openai/image-1.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/code-interpreter-chatbot-pyodide-langchain-openai/image-1.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>Next, open <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000</code> on your browser. You should see the app’s UI.</p>
<p>Try asking a question to the chatbot. For example, you can ask when were the highest and lowest closing prices of AAPL.</p>
<p>You should get the following result:</p>
<p><a href="images/code-interpreter-chatbot-pyodide-langchain-openai/image.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/code-interpreter-chatbot-pyodide-langchain-openai/image.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>That’s all! You’ve built a chatbot capable of running code on your browser.</p>

<p>I won’t cover deployment in this article. This application is pretty standard, so simply choose a method that works well for you and your organization.</p>
<p>I like using NGINX with Gunicorn and Uvicorn workers and wrote a <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/fastapi-nginx-gunicorn/">tutorial</a> about it. That tutorial uses FastAPI, but the same process would also work with Litestar.</p>

<p>Way to go! By now, you’ve built a chatbot that can run Python code on the browser and help you answer complex questions about a dataset.</p>

  <title>Semantic Search with Elasticsearch, OpenAI, and LangChain</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain">LangChain</a> is the new cool kid on the block. It’s a library designed to help you interact with Large Language Models (LLMs). Up until recently, I was building most things from scratch when working with LLMs, so I decided to give LangChain a try.</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://deepsheet.dylancastillo.co/">few</a> <a href="https://namemancer.dylancastillo.co/">projects</a> using it, I’m truly impressed. It simplifies many of the routine tasks associated with working with LLMs, such as extracting text from documents or indexing them in a vector database. If you’re working with LLMs today, LangChain can save you hours of work.</p>
<p>However, one drawback is that its <a href="https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/">documentation</a>, despite being extensive, can be scattered and difficult for newcomers to comprehend. Moreover, most of the content online focuses on the latest generation of vector databases. Since many organizations still use older, but battle-tested technologies such as <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> and I decided to write a tutorial using it.</p>
<p>I combined LangChain and Elasticsearch in one of the most common LLM applications: semantic search. In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through building a semantic search service using Elasticsearch, OpenAI, LangChain, and FastAPI. You’ll create an application that lets users ask questions about Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations and provides them with concise answers by extracting the most relevant content from the book.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in!</p>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You should be familiar with these topics to make the most out of this tutorial:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What <a href="https://blog.dataiku.com/semantic-search-an-overlooked-nlp-superpower?ref=dylancastillo.co">semantic search</a> is.</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/elasticsearch-python/">Elasticsearch in Python</a>.</li>
<li>What <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">text embeddings</a> are.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, you must install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/?ref=dylancastillo.co">Docker</a> and create an account at <a href="https://beta.openai.com">OpenAI</a>.</p>

<section id="designing-a-semantic-search-service" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="designing-a-semantic-search-service">Designing a Semantic Search Service</h2>
<p>You’re going to build a service with three components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Indexer:</strong> This creates the index, generates the embeddings and the metadata (source and title of the book, in this case), and adds them to the vector database.</li>
<li><strong>Vector database:</strong> This is a database that you use to store and retrieve the embeddings you generate.</li>
<li><strong>Search app:</strong> This is a backend service that uses the user’s search term, generates an embedding from it, and then looks for the most similar embeddings in the vector database.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a diagram of this architecture:</p>
<p><a href="images/semantic-search-elasticsearch-openai-langchain/image-12.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/semantic-search-elasticsearch-openai-langchain/image-12.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>If you’ve read my previous <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/semantic-search-with-opensearch-cohere-and-fastapi/">tutorial</a> on semantic search, you might have noticed that the <strong>vectorizer</strong> isn’t part of this architecture. I’m purposely skipping it because <code>langchain</code> takes care of that part for you, so you can have the indexer and vectorizer in the same place.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll set up your local environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="set-up-your-local-environment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="set-up-your-local-environment">Set Up Your Local Environment</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to set up your local environment:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.10</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation">Poetry</a>. It’s optional but highly recommended.</li>
<li>Clone the project’s repository:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">git</span> clone https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/semantic-search-elasticsearch-openai-langchain</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>From the root folder of the project, install the dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>Poetry:</strong> Create the virtual environment in the same directory as the project and install the dependencies:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

<span id="cb2-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">poetry</span> install</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>venv and pip:</strong> Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in <code>requirements.txt</code>:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

<li><p>Open <code>src/.env-example</code>, add your secret OpenAI key, and save the file as <code>.env</code>.</p></li>

<p>By now, you’ll have a virtual environment set up with the required libraries and a local copy of the repository. Your project structure should look like this:</p>

<p>These are the most relevant files and directories in the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>poetry.lock</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code>: These files contain the project’s specifications and dependencies and are used by Poetry to create a virtual environment.</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code>: This file contains a list of Python packages required by the project.</li>
<li><code>run_elasticsearch_docker.sh</code>: This file contains a bash script used to run an Elasticsearch cluster locally.</li>
<li><code>src/app.py</code>: This file contains the code of the search application.</li>
<li><code>src/config.py</code>: This file contains project configuration specifications such as OpenAI’s API key (read from a <code>.env</code> file), the paths to the data, and the name of the index.</li>
<li><code>src/data/</code>: This directory contains <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus_-_His_Meditations_concerning_himselfe">Meditations</a> as originally downloaded from <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page?ref=dylancastillo.co">Wikisource</a>.

<section id="start-a-local-elasticsearch-cluster" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="start-a-local-elasticsearch-cluster">Start a Local Elasticsearch Cluster</h2>
<p>Before we get into the code, you should start a local Elasticsearch cluster. Open a new terminal, navigate to the project’s root folder, and run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

font-style: inherit;">sh</span> run_elasticsearch_docker.sh</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If everything went well, a lengthy text string will appear on the terminal. For the rest of the tutorial, keep this terminal window open in the background.</p>
</section>
<section id="split-and-index-the-book" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="split-and-index-the-book">Split and Index the Book</h2>
<p>In this step, you’ll do two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Process the text from the book by splitting it into chunks of 1,000 tokens.</li>
<li>Index the text chunks you’ve generated (from now on called documents) in your Elasticsearch cluster.</li>
</ol>

<p>This code takes Meditations, splits it into text chunks of 1,000 tokens, and then indexes those chunks in your Elasticsearch cluster. Here’s a detailed breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 4</strong> import the required components from <code>langchain</code>:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>BSHTMLLoader</code></strong>: This <a href="https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders.html">loader</a> uses BeautifulSoup4 to parse the documents.</li>
<li><strong><code>OpenAIEmbeddings</code></strong>: This component is a wrapper around OpenAI embeddings. It helps you generate embeddings for documents and queries.</li>
<li><strong><code>RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</code></strong>: This utility function divides the input text by attempting various characters in an order designed to maintain semantically similar content in proximity. The characters used for splitting, in the following order, are: <code>"\n\n"</code>, <code>"\n"</code>, <code>" "</code>, <code>""</code>.</li>
<li><strong><code>ElasticSearchVector</code></strong>: This is a wrapper around the Elasticsearch client, that simplifies interacting with your cluster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Line 6</strong> imports the relevant configurations from <code>config.py</code></li>
<li><strong>Lines 11 and 12</strong> extract the book’s text using <code>BSHTMLLoader</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 13 to 16</strong> initialize the text splitter and split the text in chunks of no more than 1,000 tokens. In this case, you use <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken"><code>tiktoken</code></a> to count the tokens but you can also use different <a href="https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/text_splitters/getting_started.html">length functions</a>, such as counting the number of characters instead of tokens or a different tokenizing function.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 18 to 25</strong> initialize the embeddings function, create a new index, and index the documents generated by the text splitter. In <code>elasticsearch_url</code>, you specify the port where your application is running locally, and in <code>index_name</code> you specify the name of the index you’ll use. Finally, you print the Elasticsearch client information.</li>
</ul>
<p>To run this script, open a terminal, activate the virtual environment, and from <code>src</code> folder of your project, run the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>If everything went well, you should get an output that looks similar to this (but not properly formatted):</p>

<p>This code lets the user ask questions about Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations and provides answers back to the users. Let me show you how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 5</strong> import the required libraries:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>FastAPI</code></strong>: This class initializes the app.</li>
<li><strong><code>RetrievalQA</code></strong>: This is a <a href="https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html">chain</a> that allows you to ask questions about documents in a vector database. It finds the most relevant documents based on your question and generates an answer from them.</li>
<li><strong><code>ChatOpenAI</code></strong>: This is a wrapper around OpenAI’s chat models.</li>
<li><strong><code>OpenAIEmbeddings</code></strong> and <strong><code>ElasticVectorSearch</code></strong>: These are the same wrappers discussed in the previous section.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Line 7</strong> imports the OpenAI secret key.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 9 to 15</strong> initialize the Elasticsearch cluster using OpenAI embeddings.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 16 to 20</strong> initialize the <code>RetrievalQA</code> chain with the following parameters:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>llm</code></strong>: Specifies the LLM used to run prompts defined in the chain.</li>
<li><strong><code>chain_type</code></strong>: Defines how documents are retrieved and processed from the vector database. By specifying <code>stuff</code>, documents will be retrieved and passed to the chain to answer the question as-is. Alternatively, you can use <code>map_reduce</code> or <code>map_rerank</code> for additional processing before answering the question, but these methods use more API calls. For more information, consult <a href="https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/chains/index_related_chains">the langchain documentation</a>.</li>
<li><strong><code>retriever</code></strong>: Specifies the vector database used by the chain to retrieve documents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lines 22 to 36</strong> initialize the FastAPI app and define two endpoints. The <code>/</code> endpoint provides users with information on how to use the application. The <code>/ask</code> endpoint takes a user’s question (<code>query</code> parameter) and returns an answer using the previously initialized chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you can run the app from the terminal (using your virtual environment):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">uvicorn</span> app:app <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--reload</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</code>, and test <code>/ask</code> by making a question about the book:</p>
<p><a href="images/semantic-search-elasticsearch-openai-langchain/image-13.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/semantic-search-elasticsearch-openai-langchain/image-13.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>If everything went well, you should get something like this:</p>
<p><a href="images/semantic-search-elasticsearch-openai-langchain/image-14.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/semantic-search-elasticsearch-openai-langchain/image-14.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! You now have your own semantic search service up and running, based on Elasticsearch, OpenAI, Langchain, and FastAPI.</p>

<section id="going-to-production" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="going-to-production">Going to Production</h2>
<p>Moving to production can vary greatly for different software products. However, at a minimum, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build appropriate data ingestion and processing pipelines. When adding new data, you generally do not want to rebuild the index, as you did in this tutorial.</li>
<li>Use a production-ready <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/">Elasticsearch-managed instance</a> or a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-prod-prerequisites">Docker image</a> optimized for production. The instance used in this tutorial was intended for testing and development purposes only.</li>
<li>Choose a deployment strategy that suits your organization’s needs. For example, I often use <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/fastapi-nginx-gunicorn/">NGINX with Gunicorn and Uvicorn workers</a> for small projects.</li>
</ul>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Way to go! In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to build a semantic search engine using Elasticsearch, OpenAI, and Langchain.</p>
<p>In particular, you’ve learned:</p>

  <title>Semantic Search with OpenSearch, Cohere, and FastAPI</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Semantic search is a <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=semantic%20search">hot topic</a> right now. The fast-paced progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), as well as the availability and quality of embeddings, the key technology behind semantic search, have piqued the interest of many people in this field.</p>
<p>I’ve worked on a number of projects involving semantic search (before it was cool!), and have been closely following the progress in LLMs. So I decided to write a step-by-step tutorial that combined these two technologies.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to build a semantic search service using <a href="https://opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a>, <a href="https://cohere.ai/">Cohere</a>, and <a href="fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>. You’ll create an app that lets users search through news articles to find the ones that are most relevant to their query.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>There are a few things you need to know to get the most out of this tutorial:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What <a href="https://blog.dataiku.com/semantic-search-an-overlooked-nlp-superpower?ref=dylancastillo.co">semantic search</a> is.</li>
<li>How <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/opensearch-python/">OpenSearch</a> works.</li>
<li>What <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> are.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t feel discouraged if some of these concepts are new to you. A basic understanding of these topics should be enough to complete this tutorial.</p>
<p>In addition, you must install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> and create an account at <a href="https://cohere.ai/">Cohere</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="keyword-based-search-vs.-semantic-search" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keyword-based-search-vs.-semantic-search">Keyword-based Search vs.&nbsp;Semantic Search</h2>
<p>Search engines have evolved over time to provide users with more relevant results. In the past, search engines relied on keyword matching to deliver these results. For example, if a user searched for “AI chatbot,” the search engine would find documents that included that phrase and show them based on a ranking system like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>.</p>
<p>This method worked well for finding results that contained specific keywords but fell short when users sought information that was related to, but not identical to, their initial query. For example, a search for “machine learning” might yield more relevant results if it also considered semantically similar terms such as “artificial intelligence” or “deep learning”.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search">semantic search</a>. It is a more sophisticated method that takes into account factors like synonyms, user context, and concept relationships when generating search results. By considering these factors, this approach provides users with better sets of results.</p>
</section>
<section id="architecting-a-semantic-search-service" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="architecting-a-semantic-search-service">Architecting a Semantic Search Service</h2>
<p>Aside from the data extraction pipeline, which I’m not including here, the semantic search service you’ll create has four parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Vectorizer:</strong> This takes care of creating numerical vectors, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">embeddings</a>, from the documents (news articles) in your dataset.</li>
<li><strong>Indexer:</strong> This adds the embeddings and the metadata such as URL, title, and author to the vector database.</li>
<li><strong>Vector database:</strong> This is a database that stores and retrieves vectors representing documents.</li>
<li><strong>Search client:</strong> This is a FastAPI-based backend service that processes the user’s query, vectorizes it, and searches the vector database for the most similar vectors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a diagram of all the components:</p>
<p><a href="semantic-search-with-opensearch-cohere-and-fastapi/image.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/semantic-search-with-opensearch-cohere-and-fastapi/image.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>Next, you’ll set up your local environment to run the project.</p>
</section>
<section id="set-up-your-local-environment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="set-up-your-local-environment">Set Up Your Local Environment</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to set up your local environment:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.11</a>.</li>
<li>Clone the repository with the sample app:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

font-style: inherit;">git</span> clone https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/opensearch-cohere-semantic-search</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Go to the root folder of the project and create a virtual environment with the dependencies using <strong>venv and pip:</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

<p>The project is organized into several key files and directories, as described below</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data/</code>: This directory contains the project’s data. It contains the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szymonjanowski/internet-articles-data-with-users-engagement">original dataset</a> downloaded from Kaggle, and a sample, which you’ll use in the tutorial.</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code>: This file contains a list of Python packages required by the project and their respective versions.</li>
<li><code>run_opensearch_docker.sh</code>: This file contains a bash script used to run an OpenSearch cluster locally.</li>
<li><code>src/app.py</code>: This file contains the code of the FastAPI application.</li>
<li><code>src/config.py</code>: This file contains project configuration specifications such as Cohere’s API key (read from a <code>.env</code> file), the paths to the data, and the name of the index.</li>
<li><code>src/indexer.py</code>: This file contains the code you use to create an index and insert the documents in OpenSearch.</li>
<li><code>src/vectorizer.py</code>: This file contains the code to transform the input data into embeddings.</li>

<section id="run-a-local-opensearch-cluster" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-a-local-opensearch-cluster">Run a Local OpenSearch Cluster</h2>
<p>Before we get into the code, you should start a local OpenSearch cluster. Open a new terminal, navigate to the project’s root folder, and run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource bash number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">sh</span> run_opensearch_docker.sh</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will launch a local OpenSearch cluster. If everything went well, the terminal will show a long string of text. Keep the terminal open in the background and move on to the next step.</p>
</section>
<section id="vectorize-the-articles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vectorize-the-articles">Vectorize the Articles</h2>
<p>You’ll start by transforming the news articles into vectors (embeddings). There are many approaches you could take such as using <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/nlp-snippets-cluster-documents-using-word2vec/#cluster-documents-using--mini-batches--k-means">Word2Vec</a>, <a href="https://sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html">Sentence-Transformers</a>, or LLM-based <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">embedding</a> <a href="https://docs.cohere.ai/reference/embed">services</a>. In this case, you’ll use <a href="https://cohere.ai/">Cohere</a>.</p>
<p>Use <code>src/vectorizer.py</code> for that:</p>

<p>This code reads the news articles dataset, splits it into batches, and generates embeddings for each individual article. It works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 5</strong> import the required Python libraries and the configuration settings from <code>config.py</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 9 to 28</strong> read the news articles sample, start the Cohere client, split the dataset into batches of 96 documents (as this is the maximum accepted by Cohere), and uses the client to get embeddings for each document.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 30 to 32</strong> create a new column in the DataFrame to store the vectors and save the new dataset into your filesystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can run this script by opening a terminal in <code>src</code> and running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1">python vectorizer.py</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, you’ll create an index to store the embeddings.</p>
</section>
<section id="index-the-vectors-and-metadata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="index-the-vectors-and-metadata">Index the Vectors and Metadata</h2>
<p>After you’ve created embeddings of each article, you’ll store them, and their metadata (title, content, description), in an index in your OpenSearch cluster.</p>
<p>You can use <code>src/indexer.py</code> for that:</p>

<p>This code will create a new index in your OpenSearch cluster, and store the vectors and metadata in it. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 5</strong> import the required Python libraries and the predefined configuration settings from <code>config.py</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 9 to 16</strong> start the OpenSearch client.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 20 to 33</strong> define the settings and mappings of the index you’ll create. You set <code>"knn": True</code> so that OpenSearch knows that you’ll be using the <a href="https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/knn/index/">k-NN plugin</a> to store and retrieve vectors. Very importantly, you also need to define the size of the vector in the <code>mappings</code>, based on the model you use. Cohere’s <a href="https://docs.cohere.ai/reference/embed"><code>small</code></a> embeddings generate vectors of 1024 dimensions.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 35 to 54</strong> create the index (and delete any previous ones), and add each document one by one. You index the <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>description</code>, and <code>embedding</code> for each document.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can run this script by opening a terminal in <code>src</code> and running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1">python indexer.py</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So far, you’ve created embeddings for each document and indexed them in your OpenSearch cluster. Next, you’ll run a search client to interact with them.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-a-search-client" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-a-search-client">Create a Search Client</h2>
<p>Finally, you’ll create a search client so that users can search the articles you indexed using FastAPI. It’ll let users provide a search term, and give them back the 10 most similar documents based on that term.</p>

<p>This code lets users search through the index. It works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 6</strong> import the required Python libraries, and the configuration defined in <code>config.py</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 9 to 20</strong> initialize the FastAPI app, and the OpenSearch and Cohere clients.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 23 to 25</strong> define an endpoint that provides the user with a message explaining how to use the app if they make a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET">GET</a> request to “/”.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 28 to 49</strong> define a<code>**/**search</code> endpoint that accepts a query string parameter. It uses Cohere to generate an embedding from a query and then searches the OpenSearch index for the ten most similar documents. Finally, it formats the results as a user response.</li>
</ul>
<p>To run the app, you can use <code>uvicorn app:app --reload</code>. You can test the app by opening your browser, navigating to <code>localhost:8000/docs</code>, and clicking on <code>POST /search</code>:</p>

  <title>Build an AI Search Engine Using FastAPI, Qdrant, and ChatGPT</title>
  <dc:creator>Dylan Castillo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://dylancastillo.co/posts/ai-search-engine-fastapi-qdrant-chatgpt.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>With all the buzz surrounding <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/">Bing AI</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/">Bard</a>, I was keen on building a (tiny) AI search engine myself. After a few days of tinkering, I released <a href="https://seneca.dylancastillo.co/">Ask Seneca</a>. It’s a small app that allows you to consult a GPT-based Seneca who answers your questions and cites his sources.</p>
<p>When a user asks a question, Ask Seneca searches for Seneca’s most relevant writings to answer that question and then summarizes those writings into a coherent answer. I built it using <a href="fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://qdrant.tech/">Qdrant</a>, <a href="https://www.sbert.net/">Sentence Transformers</a>, and <a href="https://openai.com/product">GPT-3</a>. I recently updated it to use the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis">ChatGPT API</a>.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/">the</a> <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/">setbacks</a> that Bing AI and Bard are facing, the potential for this technology is vast - you could build tools for quick and efficient searches through legal documents, internal knowledge bases, product manuals, and more.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to build your own AI search engine. You’ll create an app that lets users ask questions to a GPT-based Marcus Aurelius, and provides them with concise answers and references to his <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus_-_His_Meditations_concerning_himselfe">Meditations</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it!</p>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To make the most out of this tutorial, you should know:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What <a href="https://blog.dataiku.com/semantic-search-an-overlooked-nlp-superpower">semantic search</a> is.</li>
<li>What <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/">vector databases</a> are.</li>
<li>What <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> is and how to use it.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t have to be an expert in any of these areas, but familiarity with them will help you understand the sections that follow.</p>
</section>
<section id="designing-a-tiny-search-engine-with-chatgpt" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="designing-a-tiny-search-engine-with-chatgpt">Designing a (Tiny) Search Engine with ChatGPT</h2>
<p>Before you get started, you should understand the overall approach you’ll take to build your AI search engine. There are three parts to it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Extraction:</strong> This part consists of extracting the data that you want users to be able to search. In this case, that means parsing <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus_-_His_Meditations_concerning_himselfe">Meditations</a>. I won’t go into detail about this because it is very project-specific. The <a href="https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/ai-search-fastapi-qdrant-chatgpt/blob/main/data/processed/Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus_-_His_Meditations_concerning_himselfe/Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus_-_His_Meditations_concerning_himselfe.json">parsed data</a> is available in the repository.</li>
<li><strong>Indexing:</strong> This entails indexing the extracted data so that it can be accessed later when running searches. In this case, you’ll use a semantic search approach, which means you’ll search the data based on its meaning rather than keywords. That is, if you search for “How can I be happy?” you should get passages from Meditations that discuss happiness or feeling good, not just those that contain the exact words from the query.</li>
<li><strong>Search:</strong> This consists of a backend service that processes the user’s query, vectorizes it, finds vectors in the index that are the most similar to it, and then calls OpenAI’s API to generate a summarized answer for the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is your project’s structure. Let me explain the purpose of the most important files and directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>config.py</code>: This file contains project configuration specifications such as Qdrant’s host, port, and API key (read from a <code>.env</code> file)</li>
<li><code>data/</code>: This directory contains the project’s data. It contains Meditations as originally downloaded from <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikisource</a> as well as the processed file that you will use in the project.</li>
<li><code>main.py</code>: This file contains the code of the FastAPI application.</li>
<li><code>notebooks/</code>: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for extracting, vectorizing, and indexing the data. <code>extract_text.ipynb</code> contains code to parse the HTML file and <code>vectorize_text.ipynb</code> contains code to vectorize and index the data.</li>
<li><code>poetry.lock</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code>: These files contain information about the project’s dependencies and are used by Poetry to replicate the environment.</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code>: This file contains a list of Python packages required by the project and their respective versions.</li>
<li><code>.env-example</code>: This file is an example of the environment variables you must provide.</li>
<li><code>.venv/</code>: This directory contains the project’s virtual environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! You’re now ready to get started.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="configure-qdrant-and-openai">Configure Qdrant and OpenAI</h2>
<p>Start by renaming <code>.env-example</code> to <code>.env</code>. Don’t worry about filling in the values in <code>.env</code>. After you’ve created a cluster and the API keys for Qdrant and OpenAI, you’ll fill in the blanks.</p>
<section id="qdrant" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qdrant">Qdrant</h3>
<p>Create an account at <a href="https://cloud.qdrant.io/">Qdrant</a>, if you don’t already have one. Then, on your account page go to <em>Clusters &gt; Create,</em> and create a cluster of 1GB of RAM, 0.5 vCPU, and 20GB Disk. Qdrant has a generous free tier, and it’s free to run a cluster with those specifications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extract-data">Extract Data</h2>
<p>The data extraction pipeline will vary greatly between projects, so I won’t go into too much detail here.<br>
Here are some useful guidelines to keep in mind when doing so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Garbage in, garbage out:</strong> The quality of your data will heavily influence your search results, so take your time with this step.</li>
<li><strong>Splitting documents:</strong> When you do semantic search, you need to divide documents into smaller chunks so that you can compare the similarity of each chunk to the user’s query. There is no right or wrong way to do this. In this case, I took a straightforward approach: divide the text into paragraphs, and if the paragraph is above a certain number of characters, divide it into multiple sentences.</li>
<li><strong>Production:</strong> For real-world scenarios, you should think about how frequently you’ll be extracting and ingesting data, adapting your pipeline for different data sources (e.g., scraping, APIs), and building pipeline monitors, among other things. In this example, because data extraction is a one-time event, I’m using jupyter notebooks, which isn’t always a good idea.</li>

<li><code>qdrant_client</code> and <code>qdrant_client.http</code> let you interact with Qdrant’s client, so that you can insert and retrieve data from the <strong>collection.</strong></li>
<li><code>sentence_transformers</code> let you generate the vectors from text, using pretrained models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you read the data as follows:</p>

<p>This code reads the previously processed data and removes short sentences. It works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 4</strong> read the JSON file you generated for Meditations, and save it as <code>meditations_json</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 6 to 15</strong> go through all the chapters of the book stored in the <code>data</code> key from <code>meditations_json</code> and for each chapter, it extracts the relevant data (title of chapter, URL of chapter, and sentence), and adds it to <code>rows</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 17 to 21</strong> create a DataFrame with the data from <code>rows</code> and removes the sentences with less than 15 words.</li>

<p>This code connects to your Qdrant’s cluster and creates a collection based on the name and settings you provide. In this case, you set the <code>size</code> to 384 based on the needs of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3">model</a> you’ll use for vectorizing the sentences. You also set <code>distance</code> to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">Cosine distance</a>, which will define how the similarity between vectors is computed.</p>
<p>The next step is to generate the vectors (embeddings) from the text. You’ll use a pretrained model from Sentence Transformers to generate them instead of OpenAI-based embeddings. <a href="https://medium.com/@nils_reimers/openai-gpt-3-text-embeddings-really-a-new-state-of-the-art-in-dense-text-embeddings-6571fe3ec9d9">The latter are more expensive and not necessarily better.</a></p>
<p>To accomplish this, you load the pretrained model, generate the embeddings from the DataFrame sentences, and insert them into the collection you created:</p>

<li><strong>Lines 29 to 43</strong> insert the vectors and the additional data (actual sentence, book and chapter title, and URL) into the collection in your vector database.</li>

<p>These are the two endpoints that you’ll use in your app. Here’s what each line does:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines 1 to 5</strong> set up an endpoint that accepts <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET">GET</a> requests on “/”. It returns a JSON response with a <code>message</code> key telling the user to use the “/ask” endpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 8 to 17</strong> define an endpoint that takes accepts <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST</a> requests on “/ask”, with a single parameter, <code>question</code>of <code>string</code> type. Once the user submits a request, you vectorize the question using the model you loaded previously, then you get the 3 most similar documents from your vector database.</li>
<li><strong>Lines 19 to 32</strong> combine the documents you got from the vector database with your prompt and make a request to the ChatGPT API. You set <code>max_tokens=250</code> to keep answers short and set <code>temperature=0.2</code>, to prevent the model from getting “too creative” with its responses. Finally, you extract the answer from the ChatGPT API response and return it to the user, along with the references.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to test it locally, type the following command into a terminal (inside the project’s virtual environment):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb15-1">uvicorn main:app <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--</span><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">reload</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In your browser, navigate to <code>localhost:8000/docs</code> to test your <code>/ask</code> endpoint:</p>

<p>A successful response will look as follows:</p>
<p><a href="images/ai-search-engine-fastapi-qdrant-chatgpt/image-6.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5"><img src="https://dylancastillo.co/posts/images/ai-search-engine-fastapi-qdrant-chatgpt/image-6.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! You have a working version of your AI search engine. Next, I’ll mention some ideas about deployment.</p>
</section>
<section id="deploy-your-app" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deploy-your-app">Deploy Your App</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to deploy an app, so you choose whatever approach you prefer. In my case, I like to use a VPS with NGINX acting as a reverse proxy and using Gunicorn as a process manager with Uvicorn workers. If you’d like to follow that approach, check a <a href="https://dylancastillo.co/fastapi-nginx-gunicorn/">tutorial</a> I wrote about it.</p>
<p>If you choose that route, keep the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should use <code>[--preload](https://dylancastillo.co/fastapi-nginx-gunicorn/)</code> if you want to share the same model across all the processes and use less RAM memory.</li>
<li>There are memory leak issues when serving some types of <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/2425">models</a>. A workaround that has worked for me is setting <code>--max-requests</code> and <code>--max-requests-jitter</code> to low numbers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Way to go! In this tutorial, you’ve built a (tiny) AI search engine. You’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to structure the project.</li>
<li>How to set up a vector database using Qdrant.</li>
<li>How to vectorize your data using Sentence Transformers.</li>
<li>How to use ChatGPT to combine references into a coherent answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you found this tutorial useful. Let me know if you have any questions!</p>
