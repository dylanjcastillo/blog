Today, after reading about [DHH's Omakub](https://world.hey.com/dhh/introducing-omakub-354db366), I decided to install Alacritty and Zellij on my M3 MacBook Pro.

To be honest, I was just procrastinating. 

And I've made a deal with myself: whenever I procrastinate, I have to write a TIL about whatever I did instead of my actual work (if it's something actually useful!). So, here you go.

## Installing Alacritty

Alacritty is a terminal emulator, similar to [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) and others. It's selling point is that it's very fast.

The best way to install it is using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install --cask alacritty
```

Then, you you can customize it to your liking by creating a `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` file.

I ended up modifying just a couple of things:

1. Increase padding.
2. Change the font.
3. Change the color scheme. I used Tokyo Night from [basecamp/omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/blob/master/themes/alacritty/tokyo-night.toml).

<details>
<summary>Show the code</summary>

```yaml
[window]
padding.x = 16 
padding.y = 14 
decorations = "none" # Removes the window decoration (title bar, etc.)

[font]
size = 13 #I'm getting old, so I had to increase the font size

# I like the FiraCode Nerd Font
normal = { family = "FiraCode Nerd Font", style = "Regular" }
bold = { family = "FiraCode Nerd Font", style = "Bold" }
italic = { family = "FiraCode Nerd Font", style = "Italic" }

# Tokyo Night theme
[colors]
[colors.primary]
background = '#1a1b26'
foreground = '#a9b1d6'

# Normal colors
[colors.normal]
black = '#32344a'
red = '#f7768e'
green = '#9ece6a'
yellow = '#e0af68'
blue = '#7aa2f7'
magenta = '#ad8ee6'
cyan = '#449dab'
white = '#787c99'

# Bright colors
[colors.bright]
black = '#444b6a'
red = '#ff7a93'
green = '#b9f27c'
yellow = '#ff9e64'
blue = '#7da6ff'
magenta = '#bb9af7'
cyan = '#0db9d7'
white = '#acb0d0'

[colors.selection]
background = '#7aa2f7'
```

</details>

## Installing Zellij

Zellij is like [`tmux`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux), but better. I liked that it shows you the keys you need to press to navigate, split the screen, etc. When I use `tmux` I keep going back to this [cheat sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com) to remember the key bindings.

Same as before, the best way to install it is using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install zellij
```

You can customize it by creating a `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl` file.

In my case, I just set up a tokyo night theme, copied from [here](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/blob/master/themes/zellij/tokyo-night.kdl).

```kdl
theme "tokyo-night"

themes {
    tokyo-night {
        fg 169 177 214
        bg 26 27 38
        black 56 62 90
        red 249 51 87
        green 158 206 106
        yellow 224 175 104
        blue 122 162 247
        magenta 187 154 247
        cyan 42 195 222
        white 192 202 245
        orange 255 158 100
    }
}
```

## Making Zellij play nice with Alacritty

I had some issues when trying to use Zellij with Alacritty. I could make it work when starting alacritty from the terminal but not when I launched it from the dock or with Spotlight.

To make it work, all you need to do is to add the full path to the `zellij` binary in the `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` file.

```yaml
[shell]
     program = "/opt/homebrew/opt/zellij/bin"
```
